According to Google’s Threat Intelligence Group, the hackers have been rolling out frequent updates and improvements.\n\nThe [ColdRiver][4] APT (aka “[Seaborgium][5]“, “UNC4057”, “Callisto”, “Star Blizzard”,[ ][4]“TA446”) is a Russian cyberespionage group that has been targeting government officials, military personnel, journalists and think tanks since at least 2015.\n\nAccording to Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG), the group’s new tools have evolved rapidly, showing an accelerated pace of development and aggressive operations.\n\nThe Russia-linked APT began retooling its operations with a new malicious DLL named NOROBOT, delivered through an updated COLDCOPY “ClickFix” lure disguised as a CAPTCHA. Unlike older PowerShell-based infections, this version tricks users into launching the malware via rundll32\\. \n\nThe first NOROBOT version dropped a Python backdoor called YESROBOT, but the group soon replaced it with a more flexible PowerShell variant named MAYBEROBOT.\n\nSince then, COLDRIVER has constantly refined NOROBOT, simplifying the chain to improve success, then reintroducing complexity with split encryption keys to make detection harder. These changes show the group’s determination to stay hidden and maintain access to high-value intelligence targets.\n\nCOLDRIVER shifted to a “ClickFix” lure that tricks users into running a DLL via rundll32\\. The initial DLL, NOROBOT (iamnotarobot.dll), reached out to hardcoded C2 servers, prepared the host and fetched next-stage components. Early NOROBOT versions split cryptographic keys across downloaded pieces and extracted a noisy Python 3.8 runtime, stored key parts in the registry, and created persistence via a scheduled task that launched a Python script. That chain decrypted and launched a Python backdoor named YESROBOT, which accepted only Python code as commands and proved cumbersome and short-lived.\n\nStarting in June, operators replaced YESROBOT with MAYBEROBOT and simplified NOROBOT to fetch a single logon-script payload that installed a heavily obfuscated PowerShell backdoor. MAYBEROBOT implements a compact custom protocol supporting three commands (download-and-execute, run a cmd.exe command, or run a PowerShell block) and sends acknowledgements and outputs to separate C2 paths. Compared to YESROBOT, MAYBEROBOT doesn’t require Python, is easier to operate, and offers greater extensibility, while NOROBOT continues evolving to balance stealth and deployability.\n\n_“As MAYBEROBOT became the more commonly observed final backdoor in these operations, the NOROBOT infection chain to get there continued evolving.” [states GTIG’s report][6]. “Over the course of this period of time, COLDRIVER simplified their malware infection chain and implemented basic evasion techniques, such as rotating infrastructure and file naming conventions, paths where files were retrieved from, how those paths were constructed, changing the export name and changing the DLL name.”_\n\nFrom June to September 2025, GTIG observed COLDRIVER intensifying the development of its NOROBOT malware. Simplified versions made tracking easier, while later variants reintroduced cryptographic keys and multi-stage download steps to hinder analysis.\n\nCOLDRIVER phased out the Python-based YESROBOT backdoor, which was prone to detection and limited in functionality, replacing it with the leaner, more flexible MAYBEROBOT. NOROBOT’s delivery chain evolved with rotated infrastructure, changed file names, DLL names, and export names, while MAYBEROBOT remained stable, reflecting the group’s focus on concealing delivery mechanisms while relying on a trusted payload.\n\nOverall, the campaign demonstrates COLDRIVER’s strategy of continuously refining malware delivery, evading detection, and ensuring persistent intelligence collection against high-value targets.\n\n_“It is currently not known why COLDRIVER chooses to deploy malware over the more traditional phishing they are known for, but it is clear that they have spent significant development effort to re-tool and deploy their malware to specific targets. One hypothesis is that COLDRIVER attempts to deploy NOROBOT and MAYBEROBOT on significant targets which they may have previously compromised via phishing and already stolen emails and contacts from, and are now looking to acquire additional intelligence value from information on their devices directly.” concludes the report._\n\n_“As COLDRIVER continues to develop and deploy this chain we believe that they will continue their aggressive deployment against high-value targets to achieve their intelligence collection requirements.”_\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][7]\n\n([SecurityAffairs][8] – hacking,

short-lived.","entity_type":["observable"],"mitre_attrs":["defense-evasion","persistence","privilege-escalation"],"modified_at":null,"collected_at":"2025-11-01T17:16:47.237+00:00","endpoint_ids":[1],"last_op_date":null,"provider_ids":[],"activity_type":[],"bank_card_cvv":null,"bank_card_dump":null,"bank_card_type":null,"linked_reports":["d2d070de-477d-3c04-b6a7-a2ff9bd79e59"],"linked_victims":[],"linked_malwares":[],"activity_periods":null,"bank_card_issuer":null,"bank_card_system":null,"linked_campaigns":[],"account_passwords":null,"linked_identities":[],"operations_number":null,"linked_observables":[],"enrichment_services":[],"payment_system_name":null,"bank_card_valid_thru":null,"linked_threat_actors":[],"virustotal_detections":null,"linked_vulnerabilities":[]}],"linked_threat_actors":[{"id":"0d2d64bd-6ca8-388d-98a6-469021d4ece6","name":"Callisto","tags":null,"goals":["financial","espionage"],"aliases":["TA446","COLDRIVER","SEABORGIUM"],"user_ids":null,"countries":["RUS"],"last_seen":"2025-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","created_at":"2023-12-10T00:11:04.148+00:00","first_seen":"2025-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","industries":["military","research_and_innovation","government"],"motivation":null,"updated_at":"2025-11-01T17:16:47.237+00:00","channel_ids":null,"description":null,"modified_at":null,"collected_at":"2023-12-10T00:11:28.726+00:00","endpoint_ids":[1],"provider_ids":null,"linked_reports":["d2d070de-477d-3c04-b6a7-a2ff9bd79e59","fb570bbc-ec20-3b41-98e7-79a968754049","7d5cc7b0-22b6-3d2f-81be-5e33a7138048","86f8c749-b663-345a-9f5c-2c955e469111","417f3e0e-92c2-34fb-95da-cbea309bb1c3","d458a208-81d7-3bfe-a811-e3c2a44e2cd5","d99ce9fb-91be-3b20-94f5-911a873dd0be","88277e96-726d-3aa9-b9b4-8c048a4a2c16","58c4fc4a-0613-3335-8e69-de5957fa3da9","f01f67ab-57ce-3655-9ee0-ff3b501679d6","9c19adf1-9e44-389e-ba46-a4593c4871dd"],"linked_victims":null,"linked_malwares":null,"linked_campaigns":null,"kill_chain_phases":null,"linked_identities":null,"linked_techniques":null,"linked_observables":null,"linked_threat_actors":null,"linked_vulnerabilities":null},{"id":"98a1728c-3d8f-34e3-85fa-b29b67f4853f","name":"UNC4057","tags":null,"goals":["financial","espionage"],"aliases":null,"user_ids":null,"countries":null,"last_seen":null,"created_at":"2024-02-06T00:57:34.907+00:00","first_seen":null,"industries":["government"],"motivation":null,"updated_at":"2025-11-01T17:16:47.237+00:00","channel_ids":null,"description":null,"modified_at":null,"collected_at":"2024-02-06T00:57:44.655+00:00","endpoint_ids":[1],"provider_ids":null,"linked_reports":["fb570bbc-ec20-3b41-98e7-79a968754049","d2d070de-477d-3c04-b6a7-a2ff9bd79e59","d458a208-81d7-3bfe-a811-e3c2a44e2cd5","d99ce9fb-91be-3b20-94f5-911a873dd0be"],"linked_victims":null,"linked_malwares":null,"linked_campaigns":null,"kill_chain_phases":null,"linked_identities":null,"linked_techniques":null,"linked_observables":null,"linked_threat_actors":null,"linked_vulnerabilities":null},{"id":"a9f81447-5514-3a3c-b0ac-c83d810cdfa1","name":"Star

U.S. CISA adds XWiki Platform, and Broadcom VMware Aria Operations and VMware Tools flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][1]  October 30, 2025 \n\n## U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) adds XWiki Platform, and Broadcom VMware Aria Operations and VMware Tools flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog.\n\nThe U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) [added][2] XWiki Platform, and Broadcom VMware Aria Operations and VMware Tools flaws to its [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog][3].\n\nBelow are the flaws added to the catalog:\n\n* [CVE-2025-24893][4] (CVSS score of 9.8) XWiki Platform Eval Injection Vulnerability\n* [CVE-2025-41244][5] (CVSS score of 7.8) Broadcom VMware Aria Operations and VMware Tools Privilege Defined with Unsafe Actions Vulnerability\n\nThe XWiki Platform, a generic wiki framework that provides runtime services for applications built on top of it, was found to contain a critical security vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-24893, in its `SolrSearch` feature. This flaw allows unauthenticated users, essentially any guest, to execute arbitrary code on the server, posing a severe risk to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the entire XWiki installation. The vulnerability works by injecting Groovy code into the RSS feed generation mechanism through a specially crafted request to the `SolrSearch` endpoint.\n\nThis issue was patched in XWiki versions 15.10.11, 16.4.1, and 16.5.0RC1, and users are strongly advised to upgrade immediately.\n\nThe second flaw added to the catalog, tracked as [CVE-2025-41244][6], is a local privilege escalation vulnerability in VMware Aria Operations and VMware Tools.\n\nA malicious local actor with non-administrative privileges having access to a VM with VMware Tools installed and managed by Aria Operations with SDMP enabled may exploit this vulnerability to escalate privileges to root on the same VM.\n\nAt the end of September, Broadcom [**addressed**][6] six VMware vulnerabilities, including four high-severity issues. One of these flaws is the vulnerability CVE-2025-41244 that allows local users to escalate to root via VMware Tools and Aria Operations.\n\n_“VMware Aria Operations and VMware Tools contain a local privilege escalation vulnerability. Broadcom has evaluated the severity of this issue to be in the [Important severity range][7] with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of [7.8][8].” [reads the advisory.][9] **“**A malicious local actor with non-administrative privileges having access to a VM with VMware Tools installed and managed by Aria Operations with SDMP enabled may exploit this vulnerability to escalate privileges to root on the same VM.”_\n\nThe vulnerability CVE-2025-41244 has been exploited in the wild as a zero-day since mid-October 2024 by the China-linked threat actor [UNC5174][10].\n\nAccording to [Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities][11], FCEB agencies have to address the identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect their networks against attacks exploiting the flaws in the catalog.\n\nExperts also recommend that private organizations review the [Catalog][3] and address the vulnerabilities in their infrastructure.\n\nCISA orders federal agencies to fix the vulnerabilities by November 20, 2025.\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][12]\n\n([SecurityAffairs][13] – hacking, [CISA][14])\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\n[1]:

U.S. CISA adds Microsoft WSUS, and Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][1]  October 24, 2025 \n\n## U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) adds Microsoft WSUS, and Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog.\n\nThe U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) [added][2] Microsoft WSUS, and Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source flaws to its [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog][3].\n\nBelow the list of flaws added to the catalog:\n\n* [CVE-2025-54236][4] Adobe Commerce and Magento Improper Input Validation Vulnerability\n* [CVE-2025-59287][5] Microsoft Windows Server Update Service (WSUS) Deserialization of Untrusted Data Vulnerability\n\nThe vulnerability [CVE-2025-54236][6] is an improper input validation issue. This week the e-commerce security company Sansec warned that threat actors are exploiting the critical flaw _[CVE-2025-54236][7]_ (CVSS 9.1), to hijack customer accounts via the REST API. The experts observed over 250 attacks hit stores in 24 hours.\n\nLast month, Adobe issued an emergency patch to fix the flaw, dubbed _[SessionReaper][7]_, after researcher _Blaklis_ [responsibly disclosed][8] it. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to take over customer accounts. Sansec blocked over 250 SessionReaper attack attempts on e-commerce sites, with payloads delivering PHP webshells or phpinfo probes from multiple IPs.\n\nExperts warn that the situation is critical, as only 38% of stores are patched and [exploit details][9] are already publicly available. \n\nThe second vulnerability added to the catalog, tracked as [CVE-2025-59287][5] (CVSS score of 9.8), is a deserialization of untrusted data in Windows Server Update Service that allows an unauthorized attacker to execute code over a network. \n\nAccording to [Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities][10], FCEB agencies have to address the identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect their networks against attacks exploiting the flaws in the catalog.\n\nExperts also recommend that private organizations review the [Catalog][3] and address the vulnerabilities in their infrastructure.\n\nCISA orders federal agencies to fix the vulnerabilities by November 14, 2025.\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][11]\n\n([SecurityAffairs][12] – hacking, [CISA][13])\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\n[1]: https://securityaffairs.com/author/paganinip\n[2]:

U.S. CISA adds Dassault Systèmes DELMIA Apriso flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][1]  October 29, 2025 \n\n## U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) adds Dassault Systèmes DELMIA Apriso flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog.\n\nThe U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) [added][2] Oracle, Windows, Kentico, and Apple flaws to its [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog][3].\n\n* [CVE-2025-6204][4] Dassault Systèmes DELMIA Apriso Code Injection Vulnerability\n* [CVE-2025-6205][5] Dassault Systèmes DELMIA Apriso Missing Authorization Vulnerability\n\nDassault Systèmes DELMIA Apriso is a Manufacturing Operations Management (MOM) and Manufacturing Execution System (MES) platform. It helps manufacturers digitally manage, monitor, and optimize production and logistics operations across plants and global supply chains.\n\n* **[CVE-2025-6204][4]** (CVSS score: 8.0) – A code injection vulnerability in Dassault Systèmes DELMIA Apriso that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. The flaw impacts Release 2020 through Release 2025\n* **[CVE-2025-6205][5]** (CVSS score: 9.1) – A missing authorization vulnerability in Dassault Systèmes DELMIA Apriso from Release 2020 through Release 2025\\. An attacker could exploit the flaw to gain privileged access to the application.\n\nAccording to [Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities][6], FCEB agencies have to address the identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect their networks against attacks exploiting the flaws in the catalog.\n\nExperts also recommend that private organizations review the [Catalog][3] and address the vulnerabilities in their infrastructure.\n\nCISA orders federal agencies to fix the vulnerabilities by November 18, 2025.\n\nIn September, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) [added][7] another Dassault Systèmes DELMIA Apriso flaw, tracked as [CVE-2025-5086][8] (CVSS score of 9.0), to its [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog][3].\n\nThe vulnerability is a deserialization of untrusted data issue affecting DELMIA Apriso from Release 2020 through Release 2025\\. An attacker could trigger the flaw to execute arbitrary code remotely.\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][9]\n\n([SecurityAffairs][10] – hacking, [CISA][11])\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\n[1]:

U.S. CISA adds Microsoft Internet Explorer, Microsoft Office Excel, and WinRAR flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][1]  August 14, 2025 \n\n## U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) adds Microsoft Internet Explorer, Microsoft Office Excel, and WinRAR flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog.\n\nThe U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) [added][2] Microsoft Internet Explorer, Microsoft Office Excel, and WinRAR flaws to its [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog][3].\n\nBelow are the descriptions for these flaws:\n\n* [CVE-2013-3893][4] Microsoft Internet Explorer Resource Management Errors Vulnerability\n* [CVE-2007-0671][5] Microsoft Office Excel Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n* [CVE-2025-8088][6] RARLAB WinRAR Path Traversal Vulnerability\n* [CVE-2013-3893][7] – The flaw is a use-after-free issue in mshtml.dll’s SetMouseCapture in IE 6–11 that lets remote attackers run arbitrary code via crafted JavaScript, such as an ms-help: URL loading hxds.dll.. In September 2013, security experts at FireEye uncovered the [Operation DeputyDog][8] against Japanese entities that exploited the zero-day CVE-2013-3893.\n* [CVE-2007-0671][5] – The flaw is an unspecified issue in Microsoft Excel 2000, XP, 2003, and 2004 for Mac that could let remote, user-assisted attackers execute code, as seen in zero-day attacks.\n* [CVE-2025-8088][9] – The WinRAR flaw [CVE-2025-8088][10] is a directory traversal bug fixed in version 7.13 that was exploited as a zero-day in phishing attacks to deliver [RomCom malware][9], Bleeping Computer [first reported][11]. The flaw is a path traversal vulnerability affecting the Windows version of WinRAR. Attackers can exploit the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code by crafting malicious archive files. Researchers Anton Cherepanov, Peter Košinár, and Peter Strýček from ESET disclosed the flaw. Attackers can craft archives that place executables in Windows Startup folders, causing them to run at login and enabling remote code execution. ESET researchers told Bleeping Computer that threat actors actively exploited the vulnerability in spear-phishing attacks to deliver [RomCom backdoors][12].\n\nAccording to [Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities][13], FCEB agencies have to address the identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect their networks against attacks exploiting the flaws in the catalog.\n\nExperts also recommend that private organizations review the [Catalog][3] and address the vulnerabilities in their infrastructure.\n\nCISA orders federal agencies to fix the vulnerabilities by September 2, 2025.\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][14]\n\n([SecurityAffairs][15] – hacking, [cisa][16])\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\n[1]:

Microsoft address the vulnerability in Exchange Server 2016, 2019 and Subscription Edition RTM.\n\nThe Tech giant highlights that successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an attacker to first gain or possess administrator access on an Exchange Server.\n\n_“In an Exchange hybrid deployment, an attacker who first gains administrative access to an on-premises Exchange server could potentially escalate privileges within the organization’s connected cloud environment without leaving easily detectable and auditable trace.” [reads the advisory][2]. “This risk arises because Exchange Server and Exchange Online share the same service principal in hybrid configurations.”_ \n\nDirk-jan Mollema, researchers with [Outsider Security][3], reported the vulnerability.\n\nMicrosoft is not aware of attacks exploiting this vulnerability in the wild.\n\n_“CISA is aware of the newly disclosed high-severity vulnerability, [CVE-2025-53786 ][4], that allows a cyber threat actor with administrative access to an on-premise Microsoft Exchange server to escalate privileges by exploiting vulnerable hybrid-joined configurations.” reads the [alert][5] published by the US CISA. “This vulnerability, if not addressed, could impact the identity integrity of an organization’s Exchange Online service.”_\n\nCISA urges organizations using Microsoft Exchange hybrid deployments to follow [Microsoft’s guidance][6] to prevent potential domain compromise, despite no known exploitation of CVE-2025-53786 yet. Key steps include applying the April 2025 hotfix, configuring a dedicated hybrid app, cleaning up service principals if Exchange hybrid is no longer used, and running the Exchange Health Checker. Public-facing EOL versions like SharePoint Server 2013 should be taken offline.\n\nThreat actors frequently exploit [Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities][7]. These breaches underscore the persistent risk to Exchange systems and the importance of regular patching and vigilance.\n\nWith nearly two dozen vulnerabilities exploited in the wild, it’s clear that Exchange remains a prime targe, even years after patches are issued. Organizations relying on Exchange should stay current with updates and follow CISA and Microsoft security guidance closely to reduce exposure.\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][8]\n\n([SecurityAffairs][9] –

China-Linked Salt Typhoon breaches European Telecom via Citrix exploit\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][1]  October 21, 2025 \n\n## China-linked Salt Typhoon hacked a European telecom in July 2025 via a Citrix NetScaler Gateway exploit for initial access.\n\nA European telecom firm was targeted in July 2025 by China-linked APT group [Salt Typhoon][2] (also known as [Earth Estries][3], [FamousSparrow][4], [GhostEmperor][5], [UNC5807][6], [RedMike)][7]), which exploited a Citrix NetScaler Gateway to gain initial access.\n\nIn late 2024, a large-scale Chinese cyberespionage campaign [**targeted**][8] global telecoms was exposed and attributed by the US to state-backed group [Salt Typhoon][9].\n\nIn December 2024, President Biden’s deputy national security adviser Anne Neuberger said that China-linked APT group [Salt Typhoon][10] breached telecommunications companies in dozens of countries.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal [reported][11] that the senior White House official revealed that at least eight U.S. telecommunications firms were compromised in the attack.\n\nThe Salt Typhoon hacking campaign, active for 1–2 years, has targeted telecommunications providers in several dozen countries, according to a U.S. official.\n\nDarktrace detected cyber espionage activity targeting a European telecom firm in July 2025, consistent with China-linked Salt Typhoon tactics. \n\nThe attackers exploited a Citrix NetScaler Gateway for initial access, pivoting to Citrix VDA hosts via a SoftEther VPN endpoint. \n\n_“The intrusion likely began with exploitation of a Citrix NetScaler Gateway appliance in the first week of July 2025\\. From there, the actor pivoted to Citrix Virtual Delivery Agent (VDA) hosts in the client’s Machine Creation Services (MCS) subnet.” reads the [report][12] published by DarkTrace. “Initial access activities in the intrusion originated from an endpoint potentially associated with the SoftEther VPN service, suggesting infrastructure obfuscation from the outset.”_\n\nThe nation-state actors deployed the SNAPPYBEE (Deed RAT) backdoor through DLL sideloading using legitimate antivirus executables (Norton, Bkav, IObit) to evade detection. \n\nThe attackers used LightNode VPS servers for C2, communicating via HTTP and an unknown TCP protocol to evade detection. The backdoor sent POST requests mimicking Internet Explorer traffic, with URIs like “/17ABE7F017ABE7F0”. One C2 domain, aar.gandhibludtric\\[.\\]com (38.54.63\\[.\\]75), was tied to Salt Typhoon.\n\nDarktrace’s AI identified and mitigated the intrusion before escalation.\n\nDarktrace believes the attack was likely carried out by the China-linked group Salt Typhoon (also known as Earth Estries), based on similarities in tools, methods, and infrastructure. The group is known for its stealth and use of legitimate software to hide its actions. The incident shows why traditional, signature-based security isn’t enough—detecting unusual behavior early is key to stopping such advanced threats.\n\n_“Based on overlaps in TTPs, staging patterns, infrastructure, and malware, Darktrace assesses with moderate confidence that the observed activity was consistent with Salt Typhoon/Earth Estries (ALA GhostEmperor/UNC2286).” concludes the report._\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][13]\n\n([SecurityAffairs][14] – hacking, newsletter)\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\n[1]: https://securityaffairs.com/author/paganinip\n[2]:

U.S. CISA adds Smartbedded Meteobridge, Samsung, Juniper ScreenOS, Jenkins, and GNU Bash flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][1]  October 04, 2025 \n\n## U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) adds Smartbedded Meteobridge, Samsung, Juniper ScreenOS, Jenkins, and GNU Bash flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog.\n\nThe U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) [added][2] Smartbedded Meteobridge, Samsung, Juniper ScreenOS, Jenkins, and GNU Bash flaws to its [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog][3].\n\nBelow are the descriptions for these flaws:\n\n* [CVE-2014-6278][4] GNU Bash OS Command Injection Vulnerability\n* [CVE-2015-7755][5] Juniper ScreenOS Improper Authentication Vulnerability\n* [CVE-2017-1000353][6] Jenkins Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n* [CVE-2025-4008][7] Smartbedded Meteobridge Command Injection Vulnerability\n* [CVE-2025-21043][8] Samsung Mobile Devices Out-of-Bounds Write Vulnerability\n\nIn October 2024, the IT community worldwide was shocked by the discovery of the [Bash Bug][9] flaw, a vulnerability that impacted the popular Bash component for over two decades.\n\nWhile principal vendors were working to provide the necessary patches for vulnerable Linux and Unix systems, the researcher Michal Zalewski [found two additional bugs in the Bourne Again Shell][10].\n\nOne of two bugs, tracked as [CVE-2014-6278][11], as the original [Bash Bug vulnerability (CVE-2014-6271)][12] could be exploited for remote arbitrary code execution. Experts explained that it exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169, and CVE-2014-6277.\n\nThe second flaw added to the KeV catalog, tracked as [CVE-2015-7755][13], in an administrative access issue. Remote attackers could exploit the flaw to obtain administrative access by entering an unspecified password during a (1) SSH or (2) TELNET session.\n\nThe third issue added to the catalog, tracked as [CVE-2017-1000353][14], is an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability that allowed attackers to transfer a serialized Java SignedObject object to the remoting-based Jenkins CLI, which would be deserialized using a new ObjectInputStream, bypassing the existing blacklist-based protection mechanism.\n\nSignedObject has been added to the remoting blacklist.” reads the [security advisory][15] published by Jenkins.\n\nCISA also added the vulnerability CVE-2025-4008 to the catalog. The issue is a command injection flaw in Smartbedded MeteoBridge’s web interface that allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary root commands.\n\nThe last issue added to the catalog impacts Samsung devices, it is an Out-of-bounds write tracked as [CVE-2025-21043][16]. The vulnerability resides in the libimagecodec.quram.so prior to SMR Sep-2025 Release 1\\. A remote attacker can exploit the flaw to execute arbitrary code.\n\nAccording to [Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities][17], FCEB agencies have to address the identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect their networks against attacks exploiting the flaws in the catalog.\n\nExperts also recommend that private organizations review the [Catalog][3] and address the vulnerabilities in their infrastructure.\n\nCISA orders federal agencies to fix the vulnerabilities by October 23, 2025.\n\n[Pierluigi

The flaw stems from improper input validation within the web management interface, which allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary operating-system commands on affected devices.\n\nBy sending specially crafted web requests with manipulated parameters, attackers can bypass command restrictions, alter device configurations, and execute malicious payloads. This vulnerability is particularly severe because Omada Gateways serve as central routing, VPN, and network management devices in enterprise and SMB environments. Successful exploitation can lead to full device compromise, exposure of administrative credentials, modification of network settings, and potential lateral movement within connected networks. Some related vulnerabilities further lower the attack barrier by enabling unauthenticated remote command execution (RCE), increasing the risk of exploitation from external sources. The flaw underscores the critical need for immediate firmware updates, network access restrictions, and continuous monitoring to safeguard critical network infrastructure.\n\n## IMPACT\n\n**Remote Command Execution:** CVE-2025-6541 allows attackers to execute arbitrary operating-system commands on the gateway, potentially leading to complete device compromise.\n\n**Unauthorized Access:** Exploiting vulnerabilities enables attackers to bypass input restrictions and gain control over critical network management functions.\n\n**Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can leverage command execution to escalate privileges on the device, potentially gaining root-level access.\n\n**Data Theft & Integrity Risks:** Unauthorized access can expose administrative credentials, configuration data, VPN settings, and other sensitive information, with the risk of manipulation or exfiltration.\n\n**Operational Disruptions:** Compromise may disrupt network routing, VPN connectivity, and overall device functionality, causing service interruptions and operational impact.\n\n**High Risk Due to Ease of Exploitation:** Related vulnerabilities, including unauthenticated RCE (CVE-2025-6542), increase the likelihood of exploitation, making it a critical concern for organizations relying on Omada Gateways.\n\n## AFFECTED VERSIONS\n\nThis vulnerability affects multiple TP-Link Omada Gateway models prior to the October 2025 patched firmware builds, including but not limited to:\n\n* ER707-M2: versions earlier than 1.3.1 Build 20251009 Rel.67687\n* ER8411: versions earlier than 1.3.3 Build 20251013 Rel.44647\n* ER605 V2: versions earlier than 2.2.3 Build 20251008 Rel.12231\n* ER7206: versions earlier than 1.4.3 Build 20251009 Rel.53521\n\n## SECURITY INDICATORS\n\n**Is there already an exploit tool to attack this vulnerability?**  \nAs of current public reporting, there are no widely published, confirmed exploit toolkits or public PoC scripts specifically attributed to CVE‑2025‑6541.\n\n**Has this vulnerability already been used in an attack?**  \nTP‑Link’s advisory and several news outlets state there is currently no evidence of active exploitation of Omada gateway flaws in the wild. Vendor guidance treats the flaws as high‑risk and urges immediate remediation because related issues (including an unauthenticated RCE) significantly increase exposure if left unpatched.\n\n**Are hackers discussing this vulnerability in the Deep/Dark Web?**  \nPublic reporting and open‑source monitoring show discussion across mainstream social platforms and security blogs, but there is no verified public intelligence indicating wide‑scale Dark Web trade or exploit sales specific to CVE‑2025‑6541 currently. That said, when high‑impact gateway vulnerabilities appear, chatter can migrate quickly to underground forums—so targeted dark‑web monitoring is recommended.\n\n**What is the attack complexity level?**  \nThe attack complexity for CVE‑2025‑6541 is classified as LOW. Exploiting this vulnerability does require significant technical expertise, making it accessible to both advanced threat actors and lower-skilled cybercriminals. \n\n**Historical Trends and Known Exploits**  \nNetwork appliance RCEs and command‑injection flaws are high‑value targets: past router/gateway vulnerabilities have frequently been weaponized for persistent footholds, credential theft, and lateral movement. Given that TP‑Link patched four related Omada issues (two enabling arbitrary command execution, one unauthenticated), the overall threat posture is elevated — especially because unauthenticated variants (CVE‑2025‑6542) lower the barrier for attackers. Even though there is no confirmed active exploitation of CVE‑2025‑6541 at this moment, historical patterns imply rapid weaponization if PoCs appear or scans reveal exposed management interfaces. \n\nOrganizations should immediately patch affected systems, monitor suspicious activity, and implement strict access controls to mitigate the risk.\n\n## ANALYSIS \n\n**How Does CVE-2025-6541 Work?**\n\n* The Omada gateway’s web admin interface lets admins set device parameters (like DNS server addresses, diagnostics, etc.).\n* Some of these web inputs are insecurely managed: the values are passed directly to system commands without sanitizing special characters.\n* An authenticated attacker (logged in as admin or similar) enters input containing a command separator (such as &, or |), followed by a malicious command, turning a safe command into something unsafe.\n\n**Example:**  \nSuppose there is a form to set a DNS server:\n\n* Proper use: 8.8.8.8\n* Malicious input: 8.8.8.8; cat /etc/passwd > /tmp/attacker\n* The system executes both the original operation and the attacker’s appended command.\n\nWhen this input is processed, the resulting shell command might look like:\n\nWith no input sanitization, the second command (cat /etc/passwd > /tmp/attacker) is executed with the same privileges as the admin process—potentially exposing sensitive files or compromising the entire device.\n\n## MITIGATION\n\nTo reduce the risks associated with CVE-2025-6541, organizations should implement the following measures:\n\n* Upgrade to the Latest Patched Firmware: Apply the October 2025 firmware updates provided by TP-Link for all affected Omada Gateway models.\n* Restrict Web Management Access: Limit access to the web management interface to trusted internal networks or VPN connections; block exposure to the public internet.\n* Enforce Strong Credentials: Use complex administrative passwords and enable two-factor authentication if supported.\n* Disable Unnecessary Services: Turn off any unused management protocols, services, or ports that could serve as attack vectors.\n* Monitor and Audit Device Activity: Regularly review gateway logs and monitor for suspicious command execution or configuration changes.\n* Network Segmentation: Isolate management traffic and critical network segments to reduce the impact of potential exploitation.\n* Defense-in-Depth Controls: Combine firmware updates with firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and endpoint monitoring to detect and block exploitation attempts.\n\n## EXTERNAL THREAT LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT\n\n**Target Geography**  \nCVE-2025-6541 has a global impact, affecting organizations and individuals deploying TP-Link Omada Gateway devices across North America, Europe, Asia, and other regions. Enterprises, SMBs, and service providers that rely on these gateways for routing, VPN, and network management are all potentially at risk. Given the wide deployment in offices, branch networks, and remote sites, the vulnerability represents a high-priority concern for organizations with exposed management interfaces.\n\n**Target Industry**  \nThis vulnerability poses a significant threat to industries that depend on secure and reliable network infrastructure:\n\n* **Technology & IT Services:** Organizations using Omada Gateways for enterprise network management and VPN connectivity.\n* **Financial Services & Banking:** Institutions with sensitive financial data routed through affected gateways.\n* **Healthcare & Government:** Organizations managing critical services and confidential information via enterprise networks.\n* **Education & Research:** Universities and institutions leveraging Omada devices for campus or administrative networking.\n\nAdversaries likely target sectors handling sensitive data or critical operations, increasing risks of compromise, credential theft, and disruption.\n\n**Target Technology**  \nThe vulnerability affects multiple Omada Gateway models prior to the October 2025 firmware patches. Exploitation allows remote command execution via the web management interface, potentially compromising routing configurations, VPN credentials, and network security. Organizations with interconnected networks, cloud-managed sites, or publicly exposed management interfaces face heightened exposure, emphasizing the importance of rapid patching and access restrictions.\n\n## UNDERGROUND AND DARK WEB FORUMS\n\nCurrently, threat actors are not actively discussing this vulnerability. However, the CYFIRMA Research team continues to monitor for any new developments or discussions. In the past, threat actors have exploited and sold the RCE vulnerability, as shown in the image below.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nThe case of CVE-2025-6541 underscores the critical risks associated with improper input validation and insufficient access controls in widely deployed enterprise network devices. This vulnerability highlights the importance of proactive security measures, including timely firmware updates, restricted administrative access, and continuous monitoring of web-management interfaces.\n\nTP-Link Omada Gateways, serving as central routing and VPN devices, are high-value targets for attackers seeking to gain network footholds or exfiltrate sensitive data. This incident demonstrates that even core network infrastructure can be vulnerable to exploitation if security hygiene is not rigorously maintained. Regular security assessments, network segmentation, threat intelligence monitoring, and incident response planning remain essential for organizations to defend against emerging threats and reduce the likelihood of operational disruptions or compromise.","modified_at":null,"source_file":null,"customFields":[],"published_at":"2025-10-24T00:00:00+00:00","encryption_alg":null,"linked_reports":null,"linked_victims":null,"created_by_user":null,"linked_malwares":null,"linked_campaigns":null,"programming_lang":null,"victim_countries":["USA"],"linked_identities":[{"id":"08d8063d-42ad-3d04-98a4-1d10453c3f0f","name":"TPLink","tags":null,"user_ids":null,"countries":null,"last_seen":null,"created_at":null,"first_seen":null,"updated_at":"2025-10-27T10:55:16.638+00:00","channel_ids":null,"description":null,"modified_at":null,"collected_at":"2025-10-27T10:55:16.638+00:00","endpoint_ids":[1],"provider_ids":null,"identity_class":"organization","linked_reports":["eee4c446-8bfd-31be-86b3-64408c014a73"],"linked_victims":null,"linked_malwares":null,"linked_campaigns":null,"linked_identities":null,"linked_observables":null,"linked_threat_actors":null,"linked_vulnerabilities":null}],"victim_industries":["mass_media"],"linked_observables":null,"linked_threat_actors":null,"linked_vulnerabilities":[{"id":"e6472211-5919-3ff2-a490-c8851eff9b61","cve":"CVE-2025-6542","name":"CVE-2025-6542","tags":[],"cvssv2":null,"cvssv3":null,"changed":null,"metadata":null,"reporter":null,"cvssv3_rl":"X","has_patch":null,"published":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":"2025-10-27T10:55:16.638+00:00","cpe_vendors":null,"description":null,"linked_cwes":[],"collected_at":"2025-10-27T10:55:16.638+00:00","endpoint_ids":[1],"base_score_v2":null,"base_score_v3":null,"linked_malware":[],"linked_reports":["eee4c446-8bfd-31be-86b3-64408c014a73"],"linked_victims":[],"reference_info":[],"linked_bulletins":[],"linked_campaigns":[],"cpe_configuration":null,"linked_identities":[],"linked_observables":[],"channels_source_ids":[],"linked_threat_actors":[],"linked_vulnerabilities":[]},{"id":"ef0abe40-a4fa-3fe5-8530-85057416f0c1","cve":"CVE-2025-6541","name":"CVE-2025-6541","tags":[],"cvssv2":null,"cvssv3":null,"changed":null,"metadata":null,"reporter":null,"cvssv3_rl":"X","has_patch":null,"published":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":"2025-10-27T10:55:16.638+00:00","cpe_vendors":null,"description":null,"linked_cwes":[],"collected_at":"2025-10-27T10:55:16.638+00:00","endpoint_ids":[1],"base_score_v2":null,"base_score_v3":null,"linked_malware":[],"linked_reports":["eee4c446-8bfd-31be-86b3-64408c014a73"],"linked_victims":[],"reference_info":[],"linked_bulletins":[],"linked_campaigns":[],"cpe_configuration":null,"linked_identities":[],"linked_observables":[],"channels_source_ids":[],"linked_threat_actors":[],"linked_vulnerabilities":[]}],"threat_actor_countries":null,"threat_actor_industries":null},{"id":"ed7cb381-eca2-3f65-af0a-76e04424a468","name":"September 2025 Trends Report on Phishing Emails","tags":[],"goals":null,"authors":[],"is_read":null,"sources":{"userIds":[],"channelIds":[],"endpointIds":[1],"enrichmentServices":null},"countries":[],"created_at":"2025-10-17T00:00:00+00:00","industries":[],"description":"This report provides the statistics, trends, and case information on the distribution quantity, attachment-based threats, and phishing emails collected and analyzed for a month in September 2025\\.

Researchers MEOW and Markus Wulftange of CODE WHITE GmbH reported the vulnerability.\n\n_“To comprehensively address CVE-2025-59287, Microsoft has released an out of band security update for the following supported versions of Windows Server: Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2022, 23H2 Edition (Server Core installation), and Windows Server 2025\\. Note that a reboot will be required after you install the updates.” reads the [update][4] published by Microsoft._\n\nThe flaw is a deserialization of untrusted data in Windows Server Update Service that allows an unauthorized attacker to execute code over a network. \n\nRemote, unauthenticated attackers can trigger unsafe deserialization of AuthorizationCookie objects in the GetCookie() endpoint, leading to RCE with SYSTEM privileges. The issue stems from insecure BinaryFormatter use, which Microsoft deprecated and removed from .NET 9 in 2024 due to inherent security risks.\n\nThis week, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) [added][3] the flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog.\n\nHawktrace researchers [published a PoC][5] for this vulnerability.\n\n_“The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution with SYSTEM privileges by sending malicious encrypted cookies to the GetCookie() endpoint.” [states][5] Hawktrace. “Permanent mitigation requires replacing BinaryFormatter with secure serialization mechanisms, implementing strict type validation, and enforcing proper input sanitization on all cookie data.”_\n\nThe Dutch NCSC also confirmed attacks in the wild exploiting the vulnerability CVE-2025-59287 on October 24, 2025\\. Researchers from Eye Security reported a Base64 .NET payload at 06:55 UTC that reads the ‘aaaa’ request header and runs it via cmd.exe to hide commands from logs. \n\n_“stute readers may recognize the base64 encoding. Decoding it revealed a [ysoserial.net][6] gadget chain (probably the ActivitySurrogateSelector gadget), with an embedded PE file. This was very different from the POC by hawktrace and shows that the threat actor had capabilities beyond that of a script kiddie…” reads the [analysis][7] by Eye Security._\n\nCybersecurity firm Huntress detected attackers probing exposed WSUS endpoints (ports 8530/8531) from 2025-10-23 23:34 UTC, sending crafted POSTs that triggered a deserialization RCE. The exploit spawned cmd.exe and PowerShell, downloaded a Base64 PowerShell payload to enumerate systems and exfiltrate data to a webhook.site URL. Huntress says exploitation may be limited because WSUS isn’t often publicly exposed; Microsoft re-released the patch, and the latest updates protect affected customers.\n\n_“Attackers leveraged exposed WSUS endpoints to send specially crafted requests (multiple POST calls to WSUS web services) that triggered a deserialization RCE against the update service.” reads the [analysis][8] published by Huntress. “Exploitation activity included spawning Command Prompt and PowerShell via the HTTP worker process and WSUS service binary”_\n\nHuntress also published Indicators of Compromise for this vulnerability.\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][9]\n\n([SecurityAffairs][10] – hacking, CVE-2025-59287)\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\n[1]: https://securityaffairs.com/author/paganinip\n[2]:

U.S. CISA adds Adobe Experience Manager Forms flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][1]  October 16, 2025 \n\n## U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) adds Adobe Experience Manager Forms flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog.\n\nThe U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) [added][2] Adobe Experience Manager Forms flaw, tracked as [CVE-2025-54253][3] (CVSS score 10.0), to its [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog][4].\n\nAdobe Experience Manager (AEM) Forms is a component of Adobe Experience Manager, designed to help organizations create, manage, and automate digital forms and document-based processes. It’s commonly used in industries like banking, insurance, government, and healthcare, where collecting and processing customer data securely and efficiently is critical.\n\nThe vulnerability is a misconfiguration issue that could result in arbitrary code execution, it impacts Adobe Experience Manager versions 6.5.23 and earlier. An attacker could leverage the [vulnerability][3] to bypass security mechanisms and execute code. Experts warn that the exploitation of this issue does not require user interaction and scope is changed, for this reason, the flaw is rated with a maximum severity score, CVSS score of 10.0.\n\nAdobe [addressed][5] the vulnerability in August 2025\n\nAccording to [Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities][6], FCEB agencies have to address the identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect their networks against attacks exploiting the flaws in the catalog.\n\nExperts also recommend that private organizations review the [Catalog][4] and address the vulnerabilities in their infrastructure.\n\nCISA orders federal agencies to fix the vulnerabilities by November 5, 2025.\n\n[**Pierluigi Paganini**][7]\n\n**(**[**SecurityAffairs**][8] **–** **hacking, [CISA][9])**\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\n[1]: https://securityaffairs.com/author/paganinip\n[2]:

U.S. CISA adds Oracle, Windows, Kentico, and Apple flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][1]  October 21, 2025 \n\n## U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) adds Oracle, Windows, Kentico, and Apple flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog.\n\nThe U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) [added][2] Oracle, Windows, Kentico, and Apple flaws to its [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog][3].\n\n* [CVE-2022-48503][4] Apple Multiple Products Unspecified Vulnerability\n* [CVE-2025-2746][5] Kentico Xperience Staging Sync Server Digest Password Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\n* [CVE-2025-2747][6] Kentico Xperience Staging Sync Server None Password Type Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\n* [CVE-2025-33073][7] Microsoft Windows SMB Client Improper Access Control Vulnerability\n* [CVE-2025-61884][8] Oracle E-Business Suite Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Vulnerability\n\nOracle recently [**released**][9] an emergency patch to address an information disclosure flaw, tracked as CVE-2025-61884 (CVSS Score of 7.5), in E-Business Suite’s Runtime UI component (versions 12.2.3–12.2.14).\n\n_“Oracle has just released [Security Alert CVE-2025-61884][10]. This vulnerability affects some deployments of Oracle E-Business Suite.” [wrote][11] Rob Duhart, Oracle’s Chief Security Officer. “This vulnerability has received a CVSS Base Score of 7.5\\. If successfully exploited, this vulnerability may allow access to sensitive resources. “_\n\nThe vulnerability can be exploited remotely by unauthenticated attackers to steal sensitive data, prompting Oracle to issue an urgent security update.\n\nOracle did not reveal if the vulnerability CVE-2025-61884 has been exploited in attacks in the wild or if it is linked to the recently patched [CVE-2025-61882][12]. Admins are urged to apply the out-of-band patch immediately to prevent potential exploitation.\n\nCISA also added a high-severity improper access control bug in the Microsoft Windows SMB Client (CVE-2025-33073) to the catalog, which could enable privilege escalation and was patched by Microsoft in June 2025\\. \n\nThe US Agency also warns of the exploitation of two critical authentication bypass issues (CVE-2025-2746 and CVE-2025-2747) in Kentico Xperience CMS. Both issues allowed attackers to gain control over administrative objects through weaknesses in the Staging Sync Server’s password handling. \n\nThe last vulnerability added to the catalog is a three-year-old Apple vulnerability (CVE-2022-48503) in its JavaScriptCore component. An attacker could trigger the flaw to execute arbitrary code execution when processing web content. \n\nAccording to [Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities][13], FCEB agencies have to address the identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect their networks against attacks exploiting the flaws in the catalog.\n\nExperts also recommend that private organizations review the [Catalog][3] and address the vulnerabilities in their infrastructure.\n\nCISA orders federal agencies to fix the vulnerabilities by November 10, 2025.\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][14]\n\n([SecurityAffairs][15] – hacking, [CISA][16])\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\n[1]: https://securityaffairs.com/author/paganinip\n[2]:

U.S. CISA adds Motex LANSCOPE flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][1]  October 23, 2025 \n\n## U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) adds Motex LANSCOPE flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog.\n\nThe U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) [added][2] a Motex LANSCOPE flaw, tracked as [CVE-2025-61932][3] (CVSS v4 score of 9.3), to its [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog][4].\n\nThe flaw is an improper verification of source of a communication channel vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by sending specially crafted packets.\n\nA flaw in the on-premises client and detection agent of Lanscope Endpoint Manager allows remote code execution via specially crafted packets due to improper request origin validation.\n\n_“Motex LANSCOPE Endpoint Manager contains an improper verification of source of a communication channel vulnerability allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code by sending specially crafted packets.” [reads the advisory.][5]_\n\nThe vulnerability [impacts][5] versions 9.4.7.1 and earlier. The following versions address the flaw:\n\n* 9.3.2.7\n* 9.3.3.9\n* 9.4.0.5\n* 9.4.1.5\n* 9.4.2.6\n* 9.4.3.8\n* 9.4.4.6\n* 9.4.5.4\n* 9.4.6.3, and\n* 9.4.7.3\n\nAccording to [Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities][6], FCEB agencies have to address the identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect their networks against attacks exploiting the flaws in the catalog.\n\nExperts also recommend that private organizations review the [Catalog][4] and address the vulnerabilities in their infrastructure.\n\nCISA orders federal agencies to fix the vulnerabilities by November 12, 2025.\n\n[**Pierluigi Paganini**][7]\n\n**(**[**SecurityAffairs**][8] **–** **hacking, [CISA][9])**\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\n[1]:

PhantomCaptcha targets Ukraine relief groups with WebSocket RAT in October 2025\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][1]  October 22, 2025 \n\n## PhantomCaptcha phishing campaign hit Ukraine relief groups with a WebSocket RAT on Oct 8, 2025, targeting Red Cross, UNICEF, and others.\n\nSentinelOne researchers uncovered PhantomCaptcha, a coordinated spear-phishing campaign on October 8, 2025, targeting Ukraine war relief groups, including Red Cross, UNICEF, NRC, and local administrations. Threat actors used fake emails to deploy a WebSocket-based remote access trojan for command-and-control.\n\nThe attackers used emails impersonating the Ukrainian President’s Office with weaponized PDF documents, luring victims into executing malware via a ‘[ClickFix][2]’-style fake Cloudflare captcha page.\n\nThe documents include an embedded link that redirects victims to a fake Zoom site (“zoomconference\\[.\\]app”) and tricks them into running a malicious PowerShell command.\n\n_“The PhantomCaptcha campaign employed a sophisticated multi-stage attack chain designed to exploit user trust and bypass traditional security controls.” reads the [report ][3]published by SentinelOne._\n\n_“Opening the weaponized PDF and clicking on the embedded link directed the victim to `zoomconference[.]app`, a domain masquerading as a legitimate Zoom site but in reality hosting a VPS server located in Finland and owned by Russian provider KVMKA.”_\n\nThe PhantomCaptcha campaign delivered a three-stage PowerShell payload. Stage 1 used a huge, obfuscated downloader script (cptch) that simply fetched a second-stage “maintenance” payload. Stage 2 fingerprinted the host (name, domain, user, UUID, PID), sent XOR-encrypted data to a C2 URL, disabled PowerShell history, then received an encrypted stage-3 payload. Stage 3 ran an in-memory WebSocket RAT that accepts Base64/JSON commands (sync `cmd` or async `psh`) and executes them. Then Stage 3 returns output and system identifiers, and keeps persistent reconnect logic, effectively providing the operator with a remote shell.\n\n_“The final payload is a WebSocket RAT hosted on Russian-owned infrastructure that enables arbitrary remote command execution, data exfiltration, and potential deployment of additional malware,” continues the report. “The WebSocket-based RAT is a remote command execution backdoor, effectively a remote shell that gives an operator arbitrary access to the host.”_\n\nThe researchers noted that PhantomCaptcha demonstrated moderate OPSEC, remaining active for approximately 24 hours on October 8, 2025\\. Its C2 domain, zoomconference\\[.\\]app, was hosted on a Russian KVMKA VPS (193.233.23\\[.\\]81). Investigators later linked related IPs (45.15.156\\[.\\]24 (goodhillsenterprise\\[.\\]com) and 185.142.33\\[.\\]131 (bsnowcommunications\\[.\\]com))to the same threat actors. While the lure infrastructure went offline quickly, the backend C2 remained active, suggesting compartmentalization. SentinelOne reported that attackers registered a new domain, zoomconference\\[.\\]click, the next day, hints at ongoing operations.\n\nResearchers found that the weaponized 8-page PDF tied to PhantomCaptcha was uploaded from Ukraine, India, Italy, and Slovakia, showing broad targeting. SentinelOne traced the campaign’s setup to March 27, 2025, when attackers registered goodhillsenterprise\\[.\\]com to host obfuscated PowerShell malware. The zoomconference\\[.\\]app domain was active only for one day on October 8\\. Investigators also uncovered fake Android apps on princess-mens\\[.\\]click, designed to steal data like contacts, media, and location. While attribution remains unclear, the use of ClickFix suggests a possible link to the campaign to [the Russian APT group COLDRIVER][2].\n\n_“The PhantomCaptcha campaign reflects a highly capable adversary, demonstrating extensive operational planning, compartmentalized infrastructure, and deliberate exposure control.” concludes the report. “The six-month period between initial infrastructure registration and attack execution, followed by the swift takedown of user-facing domains while maintaining backend command-and-control, underscores an operator well-versed in both offensive tradecraft and defensive detection evasion.”_\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][4]\n\n([SecurityAffairs][5] – hacking, Ukraine)\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\n[1]: https://securityaffairs.com/author/paganinip\n[2]:

Over 250 attacks in 24 hours.\n\nE-commerce security company Sansec researchers warn that threat actors are exploiting a critical flaw in Adobe Commerce and Magento, tracked as _[CVE-2025-54236][2]_ (CVSS 9.1), to hijack customer accounts via the REST API. The experts observed over 250 attacks hit stores in 24 hours. \n\nLast month, Adobe issued an emergency patch to fix the flaw, dubbed __[SessionReaper][2]_, after researcher _Blaklis_ [responsibly disclosed][3] it.\n\nThe vulnerability is an improper input validation issue.\n\n_“The bug, dubbed SessionReaper and assigned CVE-2025-54236, allows customer account takeover and unauthenticated remote code execution under certain conditions.” [reported][4] cybersecurity firm Sansec. “SessionReaper is one of the more severe Magento vulnerabilities in its history, comparable to [Shoplift][5] (2015), [Ambionics SQLi][6] (2019), [TrojanOrder][7] (2022) and [CosmicSting][8] (2024). Each time, thousands of stores got hacked, sometimes within hours of the flaw being published.”_\n\nAn attacker can exploit this vulnerability to take over customer accounts.\n\nThe situation is critical, as only 38% of stores are patched and [exploit details][9] are already publicly available.\n\n_“When we first reported on SessionReaper in September, fewer than one in three Magento stores had been patched. Six weeks later, that figure has barely improved: only 38% of stores are now protected. This means that **62% of Magento stores remain vulnerable** to a critical remote code execution attack with publicly available exploit details.” reads the [report][10] published by Sancec._\n\n_“With exploit details now public and active attacks already observed, we expect mass exploitation within the next 48 hours. Automated scanning and exploitation tools typically emerge quickly after technical writeups are published, and SessionReaper’s high impact makes it an attractive target for attackers.”_\n\nSessionReaper matches past major flaws like [CosmicSting][11], [TrojanOrder][2], and [Shoplift][12], which each led to thousands of store breaches within hours.\n\nSansec blocked over 250 SessionReaper attack attempts on e-commerce sites, with payloads delivering PHP webshells or phpinfo probes from multiple IPs.\n\nSansec spotted attacks coming from the following IPs:\n\n* 34.227.25.4\n* 44.212.43.34\n* 54.205.171.35\n* 155.117.84.134\n* 159.89.12.166\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][13]\n\n([SecurityAffairs][14] – hacking, CVE-2025-54236)\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\n[1]:

In email campaigns, Proofpoint researchers observe PDFs distributed in many ways. For example, threat actors often distribute PDFs that contain URLs leading to malware or credential phishing; PDFs with QR codes leading to malicious web pages; or PDFs with fake banking details or invoices to enable business email compromise (BEC) activity. \n\n_**Figure 1\\.** Example PDF lures used by threat actors impersonating various brands._ \n\nDue to the complex nature of the PDF format and the many ways threat actors use it to their advantage, detecting malicious PDF files can range from straightforward to nearly impossible. Proofpoint researchers have identified notable campaigns leveraging PDFs and have created a new tool called PDF Object Hashing designed to track and detect the unique characteristics of PDFs used by threat actors. The tool supports attribution by identifying PDFs that are likely associated with specific threat actors, even when attack chains or delivery methods change. \n\n### PDF Object Hashing \n\nThe PDF format is complex, which can cause issues when creating new detection signatures. One challenge detection engineers face with the PDF format is that, for compatibility reasons, the PDF specification permits multiple ways to represent a PDF that appears identical when viewed. This gives threat actors a multitude of options to introduce random variations in their malicious PDFs, making it difficult for threat detection engineers to write pattern-matching signatures that address all variations. Examples of the options for variation include the following: \n\n* Six different valid whitespace characters\n* Cross reference tables (think table of contents) can be stored in plaintext or compressed and stored in a separate format\n* Parameter values for an object can be embedded in that object, or referenced in another object\n\nAdditionally, some objects are present in the document as clear text and others are compressed in “stream objects.” A stream object is a compressed object within the PDF that the PDF viewer can still access. This means a domain that a security practitioner is trying to alert on might not be visible unless you are inspecting these compressed streams. While most detection engineers recognize that elements like URIs or lure images can change frequently, the PDF format includes numerous additional format-specific hurdles that must be considered when analyzing a file. \n\nA specific challenge in defending against PDF threats occurs when the file is encrypted. When a PDF file is encrypted, the overall structure of the document remains visible, but the details or parameters of the individual objects are obscured. The following screenshot demonstrates how objects such as URI strings are hidden when the PDF is encrypted but are visible when not encrypted. \n\n_**Figures 2 and 3\\.** Example of both a standard (obj 5) and encrypted URI object (obj 10)._ \n\nProofpoint researchers created unique PDF Object Hashing detections to combat challenges presented with the PDF format. Instead of relying on more fragile or temporary detections such as file hashes, URLs, lure images, and metadata values, we are able to focus on the structure of the document. While more robust detections exist using techniques like [dhash][1] to compare image similarity, PDF Object Hashing applies to the overall structure of the document, allowing us to ignore specific lure images. By examining the type of objects and the order in which they appear - while ignoring their specific parameters and details - we can create a “skeleton” or “template” representing the PDF document’s overall structure. These object types are then used to create a unique \"fingerprint\" of the PDF by hashing their values. Doing so allows us to search across a wide range of PDF files to detect and identify other files which potentially match the “fingerprint”. The process starts by parsing the document, following the locations of all the objects that are in use and then parsing out a “type” for each object. Below are just some of the types we extract: \n\n| Pages | Catalog      | XObject/Image | Annots/Link |\n| ----- | ------------ | ------------- | ----------- |\n| Page  | Metadata/XML | Producer      | Font/Type1  |\n\nWe then concatenate the objects in order and hash that value creating what we’ve called the PDF Object Hash. This works similar to how [imphash][2] works in PE files. We can then cluster on these hashes to help identify variations and image lure updates that may have taken place with a particular document. This is useful for identifying documents where an image lure was updated, or a URI was changed, but the overall document is still similar, which could indicate a builder or process unique to a threat group. \n\n_**Figure 4.** Overlap with PDF Object Hash (green) and then the below PDFs (yellow)._ \n\n_**Figure 5.** Two distinct lures which all contain the same types of objects._ \n\nPDF Object Hashing can be a reliable way of generating signals which can be used with other detection logic to help create more robust rules and to cluster PDF files into groups for more focused analysis. Proofpoint researchers have used the tool internally to identify documents and related activity with high confidence, improving attribution in many cases. \n\n### Campaign examples \n\nTo illustrate how PDF Object Hashing can help with threat hunting and analysis, we can look at two interesting threat actors. \n\nThe threat cluster known as UAC-0050 targets Ukraine and frequently distributes encrypted PDFs delivering malware. In their campaigns, messages contain PDF files with URLs leading to NetSupport RAT. The URL typically downloads a compressed JavaScript file which, if executed, installs the NetSupport RAT payload. \n\n_**Figure 6\\.** Example PDF impersonating OneDrive. (SHA256: ee03ad7c8f1e25ad157ab3cd9b0d6109b30867572e7e13298a3ce2072ae13e5)._ \n\nBecause these malicious PDF files are encrypted, many cybersecurity tools and other PDF parsing systems are unable to extract the embedded content, including the URI, the lure image, and parameters associated with the content of the document. Regardless of encryption, PDFs retain an internal document structure (e.g., a hierarchy of objects and attributes) that can be parsed to reveal how those objects are organized and related within the file. Using PDF Object Hashing, Proofpoint developed a unique signature for these PDFs without needing to decrypt or analyze specific contents of their internal objects. This approach allowed for the rapid identification of other potentially related PDF documents that potentially share the same structure, while also allowing us to condemn and prevent payload delivery. \n\nAnother actor currently employing PDFs and tracked using PDF Object Hashing is UNK\\_ArmyDrive. Tracked by Proofpoint since May 2025, this actor is believed to operate out of India and has a history of using PDFs as part of their attack chain. While Proofpoint has traditional detection coverage of this group, we also have augmented that coverage with PDF Object Hashing. Doing so provides additional signals from the static characteristics in their documents that we can use to find samples that may otherwise be missed if the group were to pivot away from existing lures. \n\n_**Figure 7\\.** Example UNK\\_ArmyDrive PDFs impersonating the Bangladesh Ministry of Defense (08367ec03ede1d69aa51de1e55caf3a75e6568aa76790c39b39a00d1b71c9084)._ \n\nThe open source project for PDF Object Hashing can be found in the Proofpoint Emerging Threats public GitHub: <https://github.com/EmergingThreats/pdf%5Fobject%5Fhashing> \n\n\n[1]: https://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/529-Kind-of-Like-That.html\n[2]: https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/v3.4.0/modules/pe.html#c.imphash","modified_at":null,"source_file":null,"customFields":[],"published_at":"2025-10-23T00:00:00+00:00","encryption_alg":null,"linked_reports":null,"linked_victims":null,"created_by_user":null,"linked_malwares":[{"id":"be1fc8f7-fb1e-3b50-ad57-3065aec66430","name":"NetSupportManager RAT","tags":[],"last_seen":"2025-01-14T00:00:00+00:00","created_at":"2023-12-13T13:09:20.607+00:00","first_seen":"2022-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","updated_at":"2025-10-24T11:18:34.652+00:00","channel_ids":[],"description":null,"modified_at":null,"collected_at":"2023-10-31T08:14:15.095+00:00","endpoint_ids":[1],"malware_type":["remote-access-trojan"],"linked_reports":["1891fc13-c241-3365-851b-6ef4f10eee59","6120a6ea-9773-3de2-93a3-c2e9e0eb24d7","78dc2334-698e-3f6e-9fee-bfafe62cbe40","ae81817b-af65-3170-b9ad-3f2b66118214","1f66164f-c6c3-32be-b4de-83b60a92b004","c0a5c95a-00d1-3c76-8c2c-b38bc27f4a99","1d767c29-d876-3bfa-bddf-398a731def28","e79f75bb-2bc6-3fdc-9050-49bf568247b8","3ecdb496-a004-3e22-ad47-02e15c33b540","a9731351-2005-3fa9-949c-c2d8a7bb1eed","0966591a-de21-3715-9216-d888e8da91d4","d3b3c222-c1db-3301-be4e-1fb6643e2efc","3387db16-c05d-3998-99d5-ceb3390abdde"],"linked_victims":[],"linked_malwares":[],"linked_campaigns":[],"kill_chain_phases":null,"linked_identities":[],"linked_techniques":[],"linked_observables":[],"linked_threat_actors":[],"linked_vulnerabilities":[]}],"linked_campaigns":null,"programming_lang":["JavaScript"],"victim_countries":["UKR","IND"],"linked_identities":null,"victim_industries":null,"linked_observables":[{"id":"ffdc45f4-febc-355d-a215-ef3b1bce2323","asn":null,"bik":null,"tags":[],"type":"sha256","alias":null,"owner":null,"score":null,"value":"08367ec03ede1d69aa51de1e55caf3a75e6568aa76790c39b39a00d1b71c9084","expire":null,"country":null,"category":null,"platform":null,"user_ids":[],"incidents":null,"is_active":true,"last_seen":null,"mask_type":null,"registrar":null,"tip_score":null,"created_at":"2025-10-23T00:00:00+00:00","first_seen":null,"industries":[],"updated_at":"2025-10-24T11:18:34.652+00:00","attack_type":null,"channel_ids":[],"description":"Example UNK_ArmyDrive PDFs impersonating the Bangladesh Ministry of Defense (  08367ec03ede1d69aa51de1e55caf3a75e6568aa76790c39b39a00d1b71c9084 ).

Threat actors used fake recruiter profiles to lure employees into UAV technology roles, aiming to gain access to sensitive information through targeted social engineering.\n\nThe [Operation DreamJob][5] has been active since at least 2020, threat actors have been observed using social engineering techniques to compromise its targets, with fake job offers as the lure.  \n\nThe Lazarus APT has been active since 2009 and is behind major incidents like the [Sony hack][6], [WannaCry][7], and global cyberheists. \n\nESET reports that Lazarus’ latest Operation DreamJob targets UAV technology, reflecting North Korea’s push to develop drones modeled on Western designs.\n\nESET observed new Operation DreamJob attacks starting in March 2025, targeting three European defense firms, a metal engineering company, an aircraft parts maker, and a defense contractor. The three European defense firms producing equipment used in Ukraine, attackers likely aimed at stealing UAV and weapons data. Lazarus gained access via fake job offers carrying trojanized PDFs, deploying the ScoringMathTea RAT for full control. Targets were linked to UAV technology, suggesting espionage aligned with North Korea’s drone development efforts and its cooperation with Russia in the Ukraine war.\n\nNorth Korea’s UAV program heavily relies on reverse engineering and IP theft, with drones like the Saetbyol-4 and Saetbyol-9 mimicking models manufactured by US firms. Evidence suggests Pyongyang uses cyberespionage, via Lazarus and related APTs, to steal UAV designs and manufacturing know-how. Operation DreamJob likely sought proprietary data on Western UAVs, aiding North Korea’s expanding drone production efforts.\n\nIn 2025 Operation DreamJob, Lazarus shifted tools into two tiers: early-stage droppers/loaders/downloaders and main-stage payloads like the ScoringMathTea RAT. Researchers saw trojanized MuPDF, TightVNC, Notepad++ plugins, a libpcre loader, QuanPinLoader, BinMergeLoader, and a DirectInput-style dinput.dll. Loaders decrypt AES-128/ChaCha20 payloads and load them in memory via MemoryModule. \n\nThe researchers pointed out that main implants never appear unencrypted on disk. BinMergeLoader mirrors Mandiant’s [MISTPEN][8] and abuses Microsoft Graph tokens. It is interesting to note that submissions came from Italy and Spain; one dropper bore the internal name DroneEXEHijackingLoader.dll, linking the campaign to UAV-focused targets.\n\nScoringMathTea is a Lazarus-linked RAT that supports approximately 40 commands, combining file/process control, data exfiltration, and remote command execution. \n\n_“The implemented functionality is the usual required by Lazarus: manipulation of files and processes, exchanging the configuration, collecting the victim’s system info, opening a TCP connection, and executing local commands or new payloads downloaded from the C&C server.” reads [ESET’s report][9]. “The current version does not show any dramatic changes in its feature set or its command parsing. So the payload is probably receiving continuous, rather minor improvements and bug fixes.”_\n\nFirst seen in 2022 via Airbus-themed job lures, it has since targeted firms in Portugal, Germany, India, Poland, the UK, and Italy. The malicious code is likely a key Operation DreamJob payload, it evolves through minor updates and shares traits with Lazarus tools like LightlessCan.\n\nFor nearly three years, Lazarus has consistently used ScoringMathTea and trojanized open-source apps in Operation DreamJob, achieving polymorphism that evades detection but not attribution. Despite media exposure, employee awareness in key sectors remains low. The campaign likely sought UAV-related data to support North Korea’s expanding drone program.\n\nFor nearly three years, Lazarus has consistently used ScoringMathTea and trojanized open-source apps in Operation DreamJob, achieving polymorphism that evades detection but not attribution. Despite media exposure, employee awareness in key sectors remains low. The campaign likely sought UAV-related data to support North Korea’s expanding drone program.\n\n_“Also, even with widespread media coverage of Operation DreamJob and its use of social engineering, the level of employee awareness in sensitive sectors – technology, engineering, and defense – is insufficient to handle the potential risks of a suspicious hiring process.” concludes the report._\n\n_“Although alternative hypotheses are conceivable, there are good reasons to think that this Operation DreamJob campaign was in no small part intended to collect sensitive information on UAV-related technology. Considering North Korea’s current efforts at scaling up its drone industry and arsenal, it seems likely that other organizations active in this sector will whet the appetite of North Korea-aligned threat actors in the near future.”_\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][10]\n\n([SecurityAffairs][11] – hacking, North Korea)\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\n[1]: https://securityaffairs.com/author/paganinip\n[2]:

Overview\n\nAhnlabs is monitoring APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) attacks in South Korea by utilizing their own infrastructure. This report covers the classification, statistics, and features of APT attacks in South Korea that were identified in September 2025.\n\nFigure 1\\. Statistics of APT attacks in September 2025\n\nIn Korea, most of the confirmed APT attacks were distributed through the spear phishing method. In September 2025, the attacks using LNK files accounted for the largest portion of the spear phishing attacks.\n\n#### Trends of APT Attacks in South Korea\n\nThe following are the cases and functions of the APT Korea attacks identified in September 2025, by type of breach.\n\n#### 1) Spear Phishing\n\nSpear Phishing is a type of phishing attack that targets specific individuals or groups. Unlike regular phishing attacks, threat actors go through a reconnaissance phase before launching their attacks to collect information on their targets. Threat actors then use this information to craft phishing emails, making it more likely for users to perceive the emails as trustworthy. In some cases, threat actors also use email spoofing to forge the sender’s address. The majority of spear phishing attacks include malicious attachments or links in their emails, prompting users to open them.\n\nThe following are the types of malware distributed using this technique.\n\n#### 1.1\\. Attacks Using LNK\n\n#### Type A\n\nThis type involves creating a compressed CAB file containing multiple malicious scripts, which are then used to leak information and download additional malware. The distributed LNK file contains a malicious PowerShell command. This command extracts the data of the CAB file and decoy document contained within the LNK file and creates them on the user’s PC. The CAB file is then decompressed, and multiple script files (bat, ps1, vbs, etc.) included within it are executed. The executed script files can perform malicious behaviors such as leaking user PC information and downloading additional files.\n\nThe confirmed file name is as follows.\n\n| File Name                                                                         |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1\\.

Confirmed file names\n\nThe following are decoy files that make it appear as if the user has opened a legitimate file.\n\nFigure 2\\. Identified decoy file\n\n#### Type B\n\nThis type executes RAT malware. It is mainly distributed in a compressed file along with a normal file, and the distributed LNK file contains a malicious PowerShell command.

For existence has its own order and that no man's mind can compass, that mind itself being but a fact among others.” ― Cormac McCarthy, \"Blood Meridian\"\n\nEarlier this week, I spent a few days off to take a reading retreat with my wife. Diving into several books from various genres and sitting on several quiet acres in the Texas hill country was a wonderful way to refuel. While reading a completely different book, I was reminded of this quoted section from Cormac and it gave me pause. \n\nWe, as security practitioners, often move forward with the knowledge and expertise we've acquired along the various paths that led us to this point. It's easy to fall into the trap of assuming that, because we've shared similar experiences, we all possess the same skillsets — each of us following our own string in the maze. In the end, the gaps between what we assume about each other and the reality can be tremendous. How do we ensure these aren’t the very gaps adversaries exploit, and that our perceived strengths don’t become our weaknesses? \n\nIt comes down to communication and community. Talking openly about our skillsets can feel unnecessary among seasoned practitioners—we often assume that everyone has followed a similar path through the maze of their careers. But in practice, conversations quickly reveal this isn’t the case. One of the best ways to build the soft skills that help your career grow is by meeting with your team and discussing the technical skills that got you here and how you apply them now, which skills still benefit your daily routine, and which have fallen to the wayside via obsolescence. If you can create a meeting focused on this topic — rotating among your direct team and involving the team or leader above — you’ll start to pinpoint the skillsets that have the greatest impact on your day-to-day work. \n\nThis process will help you identify specific technical skills needed for hiring or training new team members. It also gives junior analysts a clear view of what senior analysts rely on in their expanded roles, helping to guide their own education. Furthermore, when everyone understands the technical and soft skills that leadership uses, it can help remove the distance between technical and people leaders — and can leave a “string” for those early in their careers to follow as they navigate their own path through the maze \n\nKnow your environment. This is always my first answer whenever I’m asked what to do next or how to proceed. Knowing with extreme clarity both the skillsets on your team and the foundation they’re built upon will allow your team to thrive and grow. It also makes it easier to identify opportunities for cross-training and to provide targeted mentorship where it’s needed most. \n\n“War was always here. Before man was, war waited for him. The ultimate trade awaiting its ultimate practitioner.” ― Cormac McCarthy, \"Blood Meridian\"\n\n## The one big thing \n\nAccording to the [Cisco Talos IR Trends Q3 2025 report][1], over 60% of our incident response cases involved attackers exploiting public-facing applications, mainly through the ToolShell attack chain against unpatched Microsoft SharePoint servers. This is a huge jump from under 10% last quarter. About 20% of cases were ransomware-related (down from 50%), but new ransomware variants and tactics, like using legitimate tools for persistence, were seen. Attackers also increased their use of compromised internal accounts for phishing, and public administration became the top targeted sector for the first time since we began these reports in 2021\\. \n\n### Why do I care? \n\nAttackers are going after anyone with exposed or outdated systems, including local governments and public services. With attackers exploiting new vulnerabilities almost immediately (especially in widely used software like SharePoint), even small delays in patching or weak internal defenses can put your organization and its data at serious risk. \n\n### So now what? \n\nPrioritize rapid patching of public-facing applications, especially after new vulnerabilities are disclosed, and implement strong network segmentation to limit attackers' lateral movement. Additionally, enhancing multi-factor authentication, improving centralized logging, and educating your users can help detect and block attacks earlier. \n\n## Top security headlines of the week \n\n**Vulnerability in Dolby Decoder can allow zero-click attacks**   \nTracked as CVE-2025-54957 (CVSS score of 7.0), the security defect can be triggered using malicious audio messages, leading to remote code execution.

It occurs due to improper neutralization of input during web page generation, allowing attackers to embed malicious script tags directly into web pages. When another user views these pages, the scripts execute with the victim’s administrative privileges, potentially allowing full control of the system. This flaw affects all Junos Space versions prior to 24.1R4, which includes the patch.\n\nThis type of vulnerability is particularly dangerous in administrative interfaces because it can lead to unauthorized configuration changes, data theft, or further network compromise.\n\nJunos Space 24.1R4 Patch V1 fixes 162 vulnerabilities, including nine critical flaws and 24 cross-site scripting (XSS) bugs.\n\nJunos Space 24.1R4 Patch V1 resolved 162 vulnerabilities, including nine critical issue. The two most severe vulnerabilities are: \n\n* **[CVE-2025-59978][2]** (CVSS score of 9.0): A cross-site scripting in Juniper **Junos Space** lets attackers inject script tags into web pages; when viewed these run with the viewer’s administrative privileges, enabling command execution and potential full system compromise. Affects versions before **24.1R4**.\n* **[CVE-2024-47615][3]** (CVSS score of 8.6): A GStreamer OOB-write in `gst_parse_vorbis_setup_packet` lets an attacker overwrite up to 380 bytes of memory due to unchecked input array size. Fixed in 1.24.10.\n\nJuniper is not aware of any attacks in the wild exploiting these vulnerabilities, however, it recommends users to apply the patches as soon as possible.\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][4]\n\n([SecurityAffairs][5] – hacking, Junos Space)\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\n[1]: https://securityaffairs.com/author/paganinip\n[2]: https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59978\n[3]: https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47615\n[4]: http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pierluigi-paganini/b/742/559\n[5]: http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/","modified_at":null,"source_file":null,"customFields":[],"published_at":"2025-10-10T00:00:00+00:00","encryption_alg":null,"linked_reports":null,"linked_victims":[{"id":"f9e532b5-f075-313f-a215-2afb78365d19","name":"Juniper Networks","tags":null,"is_org":null,"authors":null,"user_ids":null,"countries":null,"created_at":"2025-10-10T00:00:00+00:00","industries":null,"updated_at":"2025-10-24T09:55:28.368+00:00","channel_ids":null,"description":null,"modified_at":null,"collected_at":"2025-10-24T09:55:28.368+00:00","endpoint_ids":[1],"provider_ids":null,"linked_reports":["98aab004-26b2-3d5a-9069-e74b8a807207"],"linked_victims":null,"linked_malwares":null,"linked_campaigns":null,"linked_identities":null,"linked_observables":null,"linked_threat_actors":null,"linked_vulnerabilities":null}],"created_by_user":null,"linked_malwares":null,"linked_campaigns":null,"programming_lang":null,"victim_countries":null,"linked_identities":null,"victim_industries":null,"linked_observables":null,"linked_threat_actors":null,"linked_vulnerabilities":[{"id":"5036d58f-d34f-3db9-bf01-cdd2b76e1459","cve":"CVE-2024-47615","name":"CVE-2024-47615","tags":[],"cvssv2":null,"cvssv3":null,"changed":null,"metadata":null,"reporter":null,"cvssv3_rl":"X","has_patch":null,"published":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":"2025-10-24T09:55:28.368+00:00","cpe_vendors":null,"description":null,"linked_cwes":[],"collected_at":"2025-10-24T09:55:28.368+00:00","endpoint_ids":[1],"base_score_v2":null,"base_score_v3":null,"linked_malware":[],"linked_reports":["98aab004-26b2-3d5a-9069-e74b8a807207"],"linked_victims":[],"reference_info":[],"linked_bulletins":[],"linked_campaigns":[],"cpe_configuration":null,"linked_identities":[],"linked_observables":[],"channels_source_ids":[],"linked_threat_actors":[],"linked_vulnerabilities":[]},{"id":"52df5497-d957-3fc8-a7ea-f835cce579dc","cve":"CVE-2025-59978","name":"CVE-2025-59978","tags":[],"cvssv2":null,"cvssv3":null,"changed":null,"metadata":null,"reporter":null,"cvssv3_rl":"X","has_patch":null,"published":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":"2025-10-24T09:55:28.368+00:00","cpe_vendors":null,"description":null,"linked_cwes":[],"collected_at":"2025-10-24T09:55:28.368+00:00","endpoint_ids":[1],"base_score_v2":null,"base_score_v3":null,"linked_malware":[],"linked_reports":["98aab004-26b2-3d5a-9069-e74b8a807207"],"linked_victims":[],"reference_info":[],"linked_bulletins":[],"linked_campaigns":[],"cpe_configuration":null,"linked_identities":[],"linked_observables":[],"channels_source_ids":[],"linked_threat_actors":[],"linked_vulnerabilities":[]}],"threat_actor_countries":null,"threat_actor_industries":null},{"id":"6b73e044-398e-326a-b6bd-ebf2f6405610","name":"RondoDox Botnet targets 56 flaws across 30+ device types worldwide","tags":[],"goals":null,"authors":[],"is_read":null,"sources":{"userIds":[],"channelIds":[],"endpointIds":[1],"enrichmentServices":null},"countries":[],"created_at":"2025-10-10T00:00:00+00:00","industries":[],"description":"## RondoDox Botnet targets 56 flaws across 30+ device types worldwide\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][1]  October 10, 2025 \n\n## RondoDox botnet exploits 56 known flaws in over 30 device types, including DVRs, CCTV systems, and servers, active globally since June.\n\nTrend Micro researchers reported that the RondoDox botnet exploits 56 known flaws in over 30 device types, including DVRs, NVRs, CCTV systems, and web servers, active globally since June.\n\nExperts noted that the latest RondoDox campaign adopts an “exploit shotgun” approach, firing multiple exploits to see which succeed.\n\nIn July, FortiGuard Labs first [**spotted**][2] the RondoDox botnet that was exploiting [CVE-2024-3721][3] and [CVE-2024-12856][4]. Active since 2024, it uses custom libraries and mimics gaming or VPN traffic to evade detection.\n\nTrend Micro first seen RondoDox activity on June 15, 2025, exploiting [CVE-2023-1389][5] in TP-Link Archer AX21 routersm, a flaw first shown at Pwn2Own 2023 and still popular with [botnets][6].\n\nRondoDox now exploits multiple CVEs, including [CVE-2024-3721][3] and [CVE-2024-12856][4], evolving into a multivector loader targeting diverse devices.\n\nBelow are some of the vulnerabilities exploited in the RondoDox campaigns:\n\n_“The latest RondoDox botnet campaign represents a significant evolution in automated network exploitation, demonstrating how threat actors continue to weaponize both publicly disclosed vulnerabilities and zero-day exploits discovered at security competitions like Pwn2Own.” [states Trend Micro.][7] “The campaign’s shotgun approach of targeting more than 50 vulnerabilities across over 30 vendors underscores the persistent risks facing organizations that maintain internet-exposed network infrastructure without adequate security controls.”_\n\nEven when vulnerabilities are reported and patched, attackers exploit them faster than before. Organizations that delay updates or don’t track their devices give threats like RondoDox a chance to stay in their systems.\n\n_“Moving forward, defenders must adopt a proactive security posture that includes regular vulnerability assessments, network segmentation to limit lateral movement, restrict internet exposure, and continuous monitoring for signs of compromise.” concludes the

Revisiting WARMCOOKIE\n\nElastic Security Labs continues to track developments in the WARMCOOKIE codebase, uncovering new infrastructure tied to the backdoor. Since our original [post][1], we have been observing ongoing updates to the code family and continued activity surrounding the backdoor, including new infections and its use with emerging loaders. A recent [finding][2] by the IBM X-Force team highlighted a new Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) loader, dubbed CASTLEBOT, distributing WARMCOOKIE.\n\nIn this article, we will review new features added to WARMCOOKIE since its initial publication. Following this, we’ll present the extracted configuration information from various samples.\n\n## Key takeaways\n\n* The WARMCOOKIE backdoor is actively developed and distributed\n* Campaign ID, a recently added marker, sheds light on targeting specific services and platforms\n* WARMCOOKIE operators appear to receive variant builds distinguished by their command handlers and functionality\n* Elastic Security Labs identified a default certificate that can be used to track new WARMCOOKIE C2 servers\n\n## WARMCOOKIE recap\n\nWe first [published][1] research about WARMCOOKIE in the summer of 2024, detailing its functionality and how it was deployed through recruiting-themed phishing campaigns. Since then, we have observed various development changes to the malware, including the addition of new handlers, a new campaign ID field, code optimization, and evasion adjustments.\n\nWARMCOOKIE’s significance was highlighted in May 2025, during [Europol’s Operation Endgame][3], in which multiple high-profile malware families, including WARMCOOKIE, were disrupted. Despite this, we are still seeing the backdoor being actively used in various malvertising and spam campaigns.\n\n## WARMCOOKIE updates\n\n### Handlers\n\nDuring our analysis of the new variant of WARMCOOKIE, we identified four new handlers introduced in the summer of 2024, providing quick capabilities to launch executables, DLLs, and scripts:\n\n* PE file execution\n* DLL execution\n* PowerShell script execution\n* DLL execution with `Start` export\n\nThe most recent WARMCOOKIE builds we have collected contain the DLL/EXE execution functionality, with PowerShell script functionality being much less prevalent. These capabilities leverage the same function by passing different arguments for each file type. The handler creates a folder in a temporary directory, writing the file content (EXE / DLL / PS1) to a temporary file in the newly created folder. Then, it executes the temporary file directly or uses either `rundll32.exe` or `PowerShell.exe`. Below is an example of PE execution from procmon.\n\n### String bank\n\nAnother change observed was the adoption of using a list of legitimate companies for the folder paths and scheduled task names for WARMCOOKIE (referred to as a “string bank”). This is done for defense evasion purposes, [allowing the malware][4] to relocate to more legitimate-looking directories. This approach uses a more dynamic method (a list of companies to use as folder paths, assigned at malware runtime) as opposed to hardcoding the path into a static location, as we observed with previous variants (`C:\\ProgramData\\RtlUpd\\RtlUpd.dll`).\n\nThe malware uses `GetTickCount` as a seed for the `srand` function to randomly select a string from the string bank.\n\nThe following depicts an example of a scheduled task showing the task name and folder location:\n\nBy searching a few of these names and descriptions, our team found that this string bank is sourced from a website used to rate and find reputable IT/Software companies.\n\n### Smaller changes\n\nIn our last write-up, WARMCOOKIE passed a command-line parameter using `/p` to determine if a scheduled task needs to be created; this parameter has been changed to `/u`. This appears to be a small, but additional change to break away from previous [reporting][1].\n\nIn this new variant, WARMCOOKIE now embeds 2 separate GUID-like mutexes; these are used in combination to better control initialization and synchronization. Previous [versions][5] only used one mutex.\n\nAnother noticeable improvement in the more recent versions of WARMCOOKE is code optimization. The implementation seen below is now cleaner with less inline logic which makes the program optimized for readability, performance, and maintainability.\n\n## Clustering configs\n\nSince our initial publication in July 2024, WARMCOOKIE samples have included a campaign ID field. This field is used by operators as a tag or marker providing context to the operators around the infection, such as the distribution method. Below is an example of a [sample][6] with a campaign ID of `traffic2`.\n\nBased on the extracted configurations of samples in the last year, we hypothesize that the embedded RC4 key can be used to distinguish between operators using WARMCOOKIE. While unproven, we observed from various samples that some patterns started to emerge based on clustering the RC4 key.\n\nBy using the RC4 key, we can see overlap in campaign themes over time, such as the build using RC4 key `83ddc084e21a244c`, which leverages keywords such as `bing`, `bing2`, `bing3,`and `aws` for campaign mapping. An interesting note, as it relates to these build artifacts, is that some builds contain different command handlers/functionality. For example, the build using the RC4 key `83ddc084e21a244c` is the only variant we have observed that has PowerShell script execution capabilities, while most recent builds contain the DLL/EXE handlers.\n\nOther campaign IDs appear to use terms such as `lod2lod`, `capo,` or `PrivateDLL`. For the first time, we saw the use of embedded domains versus numeric IP addresses in WARMCOOKIE from a [sample][7] in July 2025.\n\n## WARMCOOKIE infrastructure overview\n\nAfter extracting the infrastructure from these configurations, one SSL certificate stands out. Our hypothesis is that the certificate below is possibly a default certificate used for the WARMCOOKIE back-end.\n\n```\nIssuer     \n    C=AU, ST=Some-State, O=Internet Widgits Pty Ltd \nNot Before     \n    2023-11-25T02:46:19Z\nNot After\n    2024-11-24T02:46:19Z  \nFingerprint (SHA1)     \n    e88727d4f95f0a366c2b3b4a742950a14eff04a4\nFingerprint (SHA256)\n    8c5522c6f2ca22af8db14d404dbf5647a1eba13f2b0f73b0a06d8e304bd89cc0\n```\n\n_Certificate details_\n\nNote the “Not After” date above shows that this certificate is expired. However, new (and reused) infrastructure continues to be initialized using this expired certificate. This is not entirely new infrastructure, but rather a reconfiguration of redirectors to breathe new life into existing infrastructure. This could indicate that the campaign owners are not concerned with the C2 being discovered.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nElastic Security Labs continues to observe WARMCOOKIE infections and the deployment of new infrastructure for this family. Over the last year, the developer has continued to make updates and changes, suggesting it will be around for some time to come. Based on its selective usage, it continues to remain under the radar. We hope that by sharing this information, organizations will be better equipped to protect themselves from this threat.\n\n### Malware and MITRE ATT&CK\n\nElastic uses the [MITRE ATT&CK][8] framework to document common tactics, techniques, and procedures that advanced persistent threats use against enterprise networks.\n\n#### Tactics\n\nTactics represent the why of a technique or sub-technique.

Executive Summary\n\nCYFIRMA analyzed the September 2, 2025, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) cyber incident, which caused widespread disruption by shutting down global IT systems and halting manufacturing and retail operations, including at Halewood, while employees were sent home. The attack coincided with the UK’s “New Plate Day,” intensifying financial losses as dealers could not register or deliver vehicles. Although some customer data breaches have been confirmed, the exposure of internal systems by Scattered Spider Lapsus$ Hunters group on the Telegram channel and prior HELLCAT attacks highlight IT and operational risks.\n\n## Assessment\n\nOn September 16th, Jaguar announced that the forensic investigation of the cyber incident is still ongoing. As a result, the company has extended the suspension of production until Wednesday, September 24, 2025, and communicated the same update to its supplier partners.\n\nWhile JLR has not shared details on the scope or nature of the breach till now, the incident appears to align with a wider trend of advanced cyberattacks on the automotive sector. Notably, earlier this year, the HELLCAT ransomware group targeted JLR in separate attacks, exfiltrating hundreds of internal documents and compromising employee data through stolen Jira credentials.\n\n## BACKGROUND OF JAGUAR LAND ROVER BREACH\n\nEarlier, Jaguar Land Rover was Breached by HELLCAT Ransomware Group Using the Infostealer Playbook\n\nThe HELLCAT ransomware group claimed responsibility for a major data breach against Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), in which gigabytes of sensitive information were leaked, including proprietary documents, source code, and employee and partner data. The attack, attributed to a threat actor known as “Rey” \\[identified by breach tracking platforms as an active member of HELLCAT\\] on a dark forum, on March 10, 2025, posted roughly 700 internal JLR documents that were compromised. The breach was enabled through stolen Jira credentials harvested via Infostealer malware, a known hallmark of HELLCAT’s operations. The exposed data includes development logs, tracking information, source code, and a large employee dataset with usernames, email addresses, display names, and time zones. The presence of verified employee information from JLR’s global workforce raises significant concerns about identity theft and targeted phishing campaigns.\n\nHELLCAT’s attack on Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) followed its known tactic of exploiting stolen Jira credentials, a method seen in attacks on other organizations earlier. Emerging in mid-2024, HELLCAT has rapidly developed into a sophisticated ransomware group, using spear-phishing or public-facing application exploits for initial access, followed by PowerShell-based persistence, AMSI bypasses, and reflective code loading. The final payload typically delivers SliverC2, providing persistent remote access. The leaked JLR data, including source code, tracking information, and potentially cloud credentials, poses serious risks, from intellectual property exposure to potential targeting of individual customers.\n\nJust days after Rey’s initial disclosure, the JLR breach escalated when a second threat actor, “APTS,” appeared on DarkForums on March 14, 2025\\. APTS claimed to have exploited Infostealer credentials dating back to 2021, belonging to an employee who held third-party access to JLR’s Jira server. Using these compromised credentials, the actor gained entry and shared a screenshot of a Jira dashboard as proof. APTS also leaked an additional tranche of sensitive data, estimated at around 350 GB, which contained information not included in Rey’s original dump, further amplifying the scale and severity of the breach.\n\n## HACKER GROUP\n\nA Telegram channel calling itself Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters has claimed responsibility for Jaguar Land Rover’s cybersecurity incident, sharing a screenshot of Jaguar Land Rover’s internal IT systems. The channel’s name merges three English-speaking hacker collectives: Scattered Spider, Lapsus$, and ShinyHunters. Shinyhunters Collective has previously been linked to cyber-attacks on UK retailers. Jaguar Land Rover, however, has not yet confirmed the specifics or nature of the attack.\n\n## SHINYHUNTERS COLLECTIVE DISCLOSURE OF JLR INTERNAL DATA AND FUTURE THREATS\n\nOn September 3, 2025, while sharing news links related to the Jaguar Land Rover recent cyber incident, the Scattered Spider Lapsus$ Hunter Group also posted the following screenshot alongside.\n\n* From the screenshot, we find a domain ‘jlrint.com’ which is most likely a Jaguar Land Rover Internal domain. The screenshot below could reveal internal DNS and host resolution dependencies that attackers could exploit if they gained access using stolen credentials. Manipulated host files or DNS responses, misconfigured or hardcoded entries, and third-party integrations could provide avenues for reconnaissance or persistence. The internal domain jlrint.com and hardcoded production systems at Solihull and Gaydon sites highlight potential weak points for lateral movement and operational impact within JLR’s network.\n* The screenshot below reveals an internal JLR infotainment issue (SIMS-23441) related to EV charging mode transitions in the PIVI system. It exposes detailed signal names (ChargingModeChcToLatch, ChrgModReqTemp) and expected behavior tied to user interface states. The issue outlines backend-to-UI logic dependencies that are not functioning correctly. Its exposure indicates access to internal vehicle logic and testing processes, raising security and IP protection concerns.\n* This appears to be an internal debug log from a Jaguar Land Rover infotainment system, likely part of the Pivi Pro platform and captured from development hardware or software during QA testing.\n\nIt was shared by the group Shinyhunters Collective, likely as proof they accessed internal JLR systems or proprietary data.  \nWhile the log itself may not be harmful, it is potentially part of a larger breach, making its exposure concerning.\n\n* The screenshots below reveal that it could be a backend code for handling user-to-vehicle profile linking in a JLR system.It processes incoming JSON messages, extracts auth results, and logs outcomes. Likely part of a connected car or personalization module, critical to user identity and access.  \nThe exposed code reveals authentication logic, which may include potential vulnerabilities in how user profiles are linked to vehicles.  \nThis information could be used to reverse-engineer or exploit connected services, particularly if weaknesses exist in token handling or validation mechanisms.\n* The attackers accused the NCA of targeting ShinyHunters collective and escalated their threats by claiming plans to disrupt telecommunications organizations in the UK, including cutting internet lines, stealing call logs, and leaking private conversations of politicians and officials. The group, previously responsible for high-profile breaches of UK retailers, appears to be deliberately focusing on UK-based organizations, suggesting a pattern of targeting critical businesses and infrastructure within the region.\n* We have also identified multiple fake accounts posing as Scattered Spider, Lapsus$, and ShinyHunters groups. These impersonators are using Telegram channels to amplify old content and circulate the same messages. The original ShinyHunters collective Telegram account has been shut down, and the official ShinyCorp message explicitly states that ShinyHunters do not have a Telegram presence.\n* The fake groups have been reposting outdated chatter and files from past breaches, attempting to pass them off as new activity. The last legitimate update from ShinyHunters appeared on BreachForums (.hn domain), where they clarified that their Telegram account was banned and that they will not be returning to the platform.\n\n## OBJECTIVE\n\n### Why could ShinyHunters Collective have posted all those screenshots?\n\n* **Proof-of-Access:** By leaking internal domains, debug logs, and backend code, they demonstrate they have real access inside JLR’s private systems, not just surface-level data.\n* **Psychological Pressure:** Public leaks are meant to intimidate JLR, damage its reputation, and pressure it (or UK authorities) into concessions.\n* **Validation for Peers:** Sharing technical details signals credibility within the cybercriminal community, reinforcing their standing and attracting attention.\n* **Strategic Signaling:** Highlighting infotainment, EV charging logic, and user-authentication modules shows they may have deeper access into critical systems, hinting at potential for more damaging attacks.\n* **Escalation Threat:** Linking the JLR breach with threats against Vodafone UK and politicians signals broader hacktivist motives, mixing financial gains, disruption, and political messaging.\n\n## POSSIBLE MITRE ATT&CK TTPS.\n\nBased on the screenshots, leaked backend code, debug logs, and internal host/DNS entries shared by ShinyHunters Collectives, we can map possible MITRE ATT&CK TTPs.\n\n| **Tactic**               | **Technique ID** | **Technique**                                                                                                        |\n| ------------------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Initial Access           | T1566            | Phishing (Spear phishing to obtain credentials for internal systems)                                                 |\n| Initial Access           | T1078            | Valid Accounts (using stolen Jira/employee credentials)                                                              |\n| Execution                | T1059.001        | Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell (if scripts were used to deploy malware in JLR systems)                |\n| Persistence              | T1547.001        | Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder (if scripts modified registry for persistence) |\n| Privilege Escalation     | T1068            | Exploitation for Privilege Escalation (leveraging misconfigured host entries)                                        |\n| Defense Evasion          | T1027            | Obfuscated Files or Information (screenshots/code indicate obfuscation of activity)                                  |\n| Credential Access        | T1555.003        | Credentials from Password Stores: Credentials from Web Browsers (Jira credentials)                                   |\n| Discovery                | T1083            | File and Directory Discovery (screenshots show system paths, debug logs)                                             |\n| Discovery                | T1046            | Network Service Discovery (internal DNS and host resolution entries)                                                 |\n| Collection               | T1005            | Data from Local System (debug logs, source code, backend files)                                                      |\n| Collection               | T1114            | Email Collection (if internal communication/data harvested)                                                          |\n| Exfiltration             | T1041            | Exfiltration over C2 Channel (sensitive code, Jira issues, debug logs)                                               |\n| Command and Control (C2) | T1071.001        | Application Layer Protocol (C2 over HTTPS/HTTP for persistence)                                                      |\n| Impact                   | T1499            | Endpoint Denial of Service (threat of disruption to operational systems)                                             |\n| Impact                   | T1489            | Service Stop (shutdown of IT/retail systems as part of attack strategy)                                              |\n\n## HYPOTHETICAL MOTIVE OF SHINYHUNTERS COLLECTIVE SPIDER ON JAGUAR CYBER INCIDENT\n\nBased on the shared information, Shinyhunters Collective’s motives appear to be a mix of reputational and strategic rather than purely financial. By posting internal screenshots, backend code, and debug logs from Jaguar Land Rover systems, they are signaling technical prowess and gaining notoriety within the cybercriminal community. The targeting of operational systems, critical infrastructure, and connected vehicle modules suggests an interest in demonstrating control and influence, possibly to intimidate the company and its partners. While there is no direct evidence of ransom demands, the group could leverage the data for future exploitation or sell it, indicating potential financial incentives. Their references to geopolitical narratives in other posts hint at occasional ideological signaling, but the primary motive seems to revolve around recognition, influence, and potential leverage over the organization.\n\n## SCOPE OF IMPACT\n\nBased on the evidence and posts shared by the ShinyHunters Collective, the actor’s perceived impact of the Jaguar Land Rover incident appears to be significant and multi-dimensional:\n\n1. **Operational Disruption:** They likely view halting production and retail operations, including at Halewood, as a major success, demonstrating the ability to impact JLR’s core business.\n2. **Exposure of Intellectual Property:** By leaking internal debug logs, backend code, and connected service modules, they perceive themselves as having gained access to proprietary technology and sensitive vehicle system logic.\n3. **Visibility and Credibility:** Sharing screenshots and internal domain information (like jlrint.com) publicly reinforces their reputation as a capable hacker group, boosting credibility within cybercriminal communities.\n4. **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Highlighting access to authentication processes and backend systems indicates they perceive the opportunity to leverage this access for lateral movement, further attacks, or resale of stolen data.\n5. **Psychological and Strategic Pressure:** By posting on Telegram and referencing other targets (like Vodafone UK), they signal the ability to expand attacks, aiming to create fear and uncertainty among JLR, its partners, and the public.\n6. **Industry-wide Implications:** The actor likely perceives their actions as part of a larger pattern of disrupting the automotive sector, potentially influencing competitors, suppliers, and customers to view cybersecurity as a systemic vulnerability.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nThe analysis suggests that the Jaguar Land Rover cyber incident not only disrupted operations but also exposed weaknesses across both IT and OT environments. Although no direct compromise of customer data has been confirmed, past breaches and leaked internal information increase the risks of credential theft, intellectual property exposure, and follow-on targeted attacks.  \nAs the forensic investigation is still ongoing, the exact tactics used by the threat actors and their attribution remain unverified. Researchers, media outlets, and our own assessment indicate with medium confidence that the group ShinHhunters Collective may be responsible. However, we will await the official findings before making a definitive attribution.\n\n## RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n**Strategic Recommendations:** Implement a comprehensive cyber resilience framework across IT and OT environments, ensuring regular risk assessments, supplier audits, and integration of lessons learned from industry incidents like JLR and Mitsubishi Electric SCADA vulnerabilities.\n\n**Technical Recommendations:** Strengthen access controls by enforcing multi-factor authentication, regular credential rotation, and monitoring for compromised accounts; deploy advanced endpoint and network detection solutions to detect lateral movement or abnormal activity early.\n\n**Operational Recommendations:** Develop and test incident response and business continuity plans that account for operational downtime, supply chain disruptions, and critical production halts; conduct employee training and simulations for cyber-attack scenarios.\n\n**Tactical Recommendations:** Regularly perform tabletop exercises and red-team simulations targeting both IT and OT environments to test response procedures, validate detection capabilities, and ensure teams can quickly contain and remediate incidents similar to JLR or HELLCAT-style

September 3, 2025, while sharing news links related to the Jaguar Land Rover recent cyber incident, the Scattered Spider Lapsus$ Hunter Group also posted the following screenshot alongside. From the screenshot, we find a domain '  jlrint.com ' which is most likely a Jaguar Land Rover Internal domain. The screenshot below could reveal internal DNS and host resolution dependencies that attackers could exploit if they gained access using stolen credentials. Manipulated host files or DNS responses, misconfigured or hardcoded entries, and third-party integrations could provide avenues for reconnaissance or persistence. The internal domain  jlrint.com and hardcoded production systems at Solihull and Gaydon sites highlight potential weak points for lateral movement and operational impact within JLR's network.\n\nVisibility and Credibility: Sharing screenshots and internal domain information (like  jlrint.com ) publicly reinforces their reputation as a capable hacker group, boosting credibility within cybercriminal communities. Potential for Further Exploitation: Highlighting access to authentication processes and backend systems indicates they perceive the opportunity to leverage this access for lateral movement, further attacks, or resale of stolen data. Psychological and Strategic Pressure: By posting on Telegram and referencing other targets (like Vodafone UK), they signal the ability to expand attacks, aiming to create fear and uncertainty among JLR, its partners, and the public.","entity_type":["ioc"],"mitre_attrs":["defense-evasion","initial-access"],"modified_at":null,"collected_at":"2025-10-24T09:37:26.975+00:00","endpoint_ids":[1],"last_op_date":null,"provider_ids":[],"activity_type":[],"bank_card_cvv":null,"bank_card_dump":null,"bank_card_type":null,"linked_reports":["b9343e01-3edb-3a7f-990e-55f4f6f3aef6"],"linked_victims":[],"linked_malwares":[],"activity_periods":null,"bank_card_issuer":null,"bank_card_system":null,"linked_campaigns":[],"account_passwords":null,"linked_identities":[],"operations_number":null,"linked_observables":[],"enrichment_services":[],"payment_system_name":null,"bank_card_valid_thru":null,"linked_threat_actors":[],"virustotal_detections":null,"linked_vulnerabilities":[]}],"linked_threat_actors":[{"id":"5618083e-44ef-3e41-9441-cb8db11a373f","name":"Scattered

Ransomware Group**\n\nThe DireWolf ransomware group made their first appearance in May 2025\\. On May 26 of the same month, they disclosed their first 6 victims on a darknet leak site, marking the beginning of their full-fledged activities. The group stated that their only goal is money and contacts their victims through the Tox messenger. Their targets come from a variety of industries, including manufacturing, IT, construction, and finance in Asia, Australia, Italy, and others. They use a double extortion technique that involves both encrypting data and threatening to leak it. So far, 16 organizations in 16 regions have fallen victim to their attacks, including the United States, Thailand, and Taiwan.\n\n  \nFigure 1\\. DireWolf victim board\n  \n  \n**Analysis Details**\n\n  \nFigure 2\\. DireWolf execution flow\n\nDireWolf controls its operations based on command-line arguments without a configuration file. The -d argument can be used to specify a specific directory as a target, and the -h argument prints the execution help. After processing the arguments, an initial protection check is immediately performed. This check uses the system-wide mutex Global\\\\direwolfAppMutex to determine whether the program is already running, and it also checks for the presence of the encrypted completion marker, C:\\\\runfinish.exe, to identify whether the system has already been processed. If either of these conditions are met, the program immediately halts further execution, logs the event, and then calls its self-deletion routine to remove the executable and terminate.\n\nConversely, if the condition is met, the pre-processing routine is launched and then a worker pool is configured after a 2-second delay. The size of the worker pool is managed as a global variable, and a number of goroutines equivalent to 8 times the number of logical CPUs are concurrently injected to process the target path in parallel. This design maximizes throughput by filling the I/O wait time with other tasks, but depending on the system, it can significantly increase CPU usage and the disk queue, leading to performance degradation and service delays.\n\nRansomware applies various anti-recovery techniques to maximize the success rate of file encryption. First, it reduces analysis traces through self-deletion and deletes event logs and backup-related data, making incident analysis and system recovery difficult. The running Windows event log service (eventlog) identifies the process ID through a WMI query (Get-WmiObject -Class win32\\_service -Filter “name = ‘eventlog'”) and then forcibly terminates it with the taskkill command.\n\nThis process is not a one-time event but is performed in the form of ① checking the event log process ID → ② force closing it → ③ waiting for a certain amount of time and repeating the same procedure. This means that even if the eventlog service is restarted, it is periodically explored and terminated, so log collection remains blocked.\n\n  \nFigure 3\\. Part of the infinite loop function that deletes event logs\n\nThey also used the command prompt to completely delete system restore points (shadow copies) and delete scheduled backup tasks and metadata. For example, the vssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet command can be used to delete all volume shadow copies, and the wbadmin command can be used to stop running backup tasks (wbadmin stop job -quiet), perform system status backups, and delete all backup versions (wbadmin delete backup -keepVersions:0 -quiet). They used the bcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled No command to disable the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) and the bcdedit /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures command to prevent recovery mode from being entered when booting fails. Afterward, they used the wevtutil cl command to delete the major event logs, including the Application, System, Security, and Setup logs.\n\n  \nFigure 4\\. List of recovery commands\n\nFurthermore, the ransomware terminates specific processes in advance to disrupt the normal recovery procedures before encrypting files. The targets include databases (MSSQL, Oracle), mail servers (Exchange), virtualization platforms (VMware), backup software (Veeam, Veritas BackupExec), and security solutions (Symantec, Sophos). Major examples include sqlservr.exe, vss.exe, memtas.exe, tomcat6.exe, onenote.exe, and outlook.exe. This aims to disable processes related to data storage, management, collaboration, and security, thus preventing recovery and normal operation.\n\nAdditionally, various services are targeted for termination to render recovery and security features powerless. Identified services include BackupExecJobEngine, SQLSERVERAGENT, wuauserv, VeeamTransportSvc, and MSExchangeIS, which play a crucial role in backup management, database operation, Windows update, virtualization resource management, and mail server operation. The termination of these services not only involves the deletion of recovery points and disabling of backups, but also simultaneously renders monitoring and security features powerless, maximizing the effects of detection evasion and analysis disruption.\n\nIn the pre-encryption phase, the malware forcibly terminates processes and services related to backup, security, database, and email servers to prevent recovery. It then executes the actual encryption routine. The encryption process differs based on the arguments provided when the ransomware is executed. If the -d argument is provided, the malware only traverses the specified directory and its subdirectories. If no argument is provided, it targets all connected local and network drives except for CD/ROM drives. During the target directory exploration process, encryption exception conditions are applied. This includes essential folders for the operating system and recovery such as AppData, Windows, Program Files, $Recycle.Bin, and system volume information. It also includes system paths such as bootmgr, ntldr, and NTUSER.DAT, and file names such as HowToRecoveryFiles.txt. Additionally, certain file extensions are excluded from being encrypted, such as executable files (.exe), libraries (.dll), drivers (.sys, .drv), and images (.iso, .img). These exceptions are in place to ensure that the system remains operable after encryption. This allows the ransom note to be displayed and enables the victim to proceed with the payment process.\n\nFirst, a random-based private key is created to generate an independent encryption key for each file. This key is then used to perform the Curve25519 key exchange operation with the DireWolf public key that is hard-coded in the malware. The shared secret generated through this process is put through the SHA-256 algorithm to be used as the encryption key, and the same encryption value result is processed again to derive the nonce value. This key-nonce pair is used as the input for the ChaCha20 stream cipher algorithm during the encryption process. ChaCha20 is known for its high speeds and suitability for processing large amounts of data. DireWolf also applies encryption strategies based on the file size. Small files under 1 MB are fully encrypted, while large files over 1 MB have only the first 1 MB segment encrypted. This method provides a similar level of protection to full encryption while significantly increasing the processing speed. This approach is designed to allow the threat actor to damage as many files as possible within a short time frame, reducing the possibility of recovery and strengthening their negotiation position.\n\n  \nFigure 5\\. Encryption structure\n\nAfter all encryption processes are completed, the ransomware performs post-processing. First, the malware creates an empty marker file in the C:\\\\runfinish.exe path to record the completion status of the encryption process. This marker is used as a checkpoint to prevent the duplication of encryption in the same system and to prevent unnecessary re-encryption from occurring. Then, the cmd /c start shutdown -r -f -t 10 command is called to schedule a forced reboot 10 seconds later. The -r flag is used to reboot the system, the -f flag is used to forcibly terminate all running user processes, and the -t 10 option is used to add a 10-second delay, minimizing the time available for users to respond. When executed, the start command separates the process into a separate process context, allowing the reboot command to be executed independently even if the main process is terminated.\n\nRegardless of whether the reboot is successful or not, the self-deletion routine is always executed. Specifically, it involves using the timeout /T 3 command to wait for 3 seconds before executing the del command. This also involves invoking cmd.exe as a separate process and executing it asynchronously. As a result, even if the system is actually rebooted, the process continues to run and triggers self-deletion, removing the malicious executable from the disk. This makes it difficult for security personnel or analysts to collect samples from the site after a reboot, and it also becomes challenging to obtain the original malware file during the forensic analysis process.\n\nThe ransom note is created under the name “HowToRecoveryFiles.txt”. As the ransom note is created in the path after the encryption process of a specific folder is completed, a ransom note is created in all folders on the system.\n\n  \nFigure 6\\. Ransom note\n\nThe ransom note includes a hard-coded roomID and username, which are the names of the affected company, showing that a breach had already occurred against the company before the ransomware was executed. The threat actor also uploaded some of the leaked files to a free file-sharing site, allowing them to be accessed and using this as a means of proving that the data had actually been stolen and threatening the victim.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDespite being a newly emerged group in May 2025, DireWolf has been actively launching attacks against companies worldwide. They pose a high threat to any organization with vulnerable systems, regardless of the industry, including manufacturing, IT, construction, and finance. Technically, DireWolf performs file encryption by combining Curve25519-based key exchange with ChaCha20 stream encryption. In this process, a random session key is generated for each file, and the threat actor’s hard-coded public key and shared secret are used to derive the encryption key. The key is then passed through SHA-256 and used as the encryption key and nonce, ultimately giving the affected file the .direwolf extension. This design effectively blocks all known decryption methods, leaving victims with no means of recovery other than negotiating with the threat actor. DireWolf also goes beyond file encryption by actively employing anti-recovery and anti-analysis techniques. It proactively terminates backup and restoration processes and services (such as Veeam, Veritas, MSSQL, Exchange, and security solutions) and deletes event logs and disables recovery environments using the wevtutil, wbadmin, and bcdedit commands. After encryption is complete, it attempts to force a reboot using the shutdown -r -f -t 10 command and removes the malicious executable file using a self-deletion routine, significantly reducing the likelihood of forensic analysis and malware recovery.\n\n**AhnLab’s Response**\n\nDetection names and engine dates of AhnLab products are as

check uses the system-wide mutex Global\\direwolfAppMutex to determine whether the program is already running, and it also checks for the presence of the encrypted completion marker,  runfinish.exe , to identify whether the system has already been processed. If either of these conditions are met, the program immediately halts further execution, logs the event, and then calls its self-deletion routine to remove the executable and terminate. Conversely, if the condition is met, the pre-processing routine is launched and then a worker pool is configured after a 2-second delay. The size of the worker pool is managed as a global variable, and a number of goroutines equivalent to 8 times the number of logical CPUs are concurrently injected to process the target path in parallel. This design maximizes throughput by filling the I/O wait time with other tasks, but depending on the system, it can significantly increase CPU usage and the disk queue, leading to performance degradation and service delays.","entity_type":["observable"],"mitre_attrs":["defense-evasion","execution","privilege-escalation"],"modified_at":null,"collected_at":"2025-10-24T09:32:15.029+00:00","endpoint_ids":[1],"last_op_date":null,"provider_ids":[],"activity_type":[],"bank_card_cvv":null,"bank_card_dump":null,"bank_card_type":null,"linked_reports":["dd854ff1-6cc2-38d8-a7c0-4dd4d71d8b0a"],"linked_victims":[],"linked_malwares":[],"activity_periods":null,"bank_card_issuer":null,"bank_card_system":null,"linked_campaigns":[],"account_passwords":null,"linked_identities":[],"operations_number":null,"linked_observables":[],"enrichment_services":[],"payment_system_name":null,"bank_card_valid_thru":null,"linked_threat_actors":[],"virustotal_detections":null,"linked_vulnerabilities":[]},{"id":"2d71e95e-9ef2-3d03-98fc-c1b8e64180b7","asn":null,"bik":null,"tags":[],"type":"md5","alias":null,"owner":null,"score":null,"value":"bc6912c853be5907438b4978f6c49e43","expire":null,"country":null,"category":null,"platform":null,"user_ids":[],"incidents":null,"is_active":true,"last_seen":null,"mask_type":null,"registrar":null,"tip_score":null,"created_at":"2025-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","first_seen":null,"industries":[],"updated_at":"2025-10-24T09:32:15.029+00:00","attack_type":null,"channel_ids":[],"description":"EDR SystemManipulation/EDR.Event.M2486 (2022.07.09.00) SystemManipulation/EDR.Event.M1751(2018.09.08.00) Ransom/MDP.Event.M1946 (2018.09.07.03) Ransom/EDR.Decoy.M2470 (2022.09.30.00) MD5  333fd9dd9d84b58c4eef84a8d07670dd  44da29144b151062bce633e9ce62de85  aa62b3905be9b49551a07bc16eaad2ff  bc6912c853be5907438b4978f6c49e43","entity_type":["ioc"],"mitre_attrs":["defense-evasion","execution","privilege-escalation"],"modified_at":null,"collected_at":"2025-10-24T09:32:15.029+00:00","endpoint_ids":[1],"last_op_date":null,"provider_ids":[],"activity_type":[],"bank_card_cvv":null,"bank_card_dump":null,"bank_card_type":null,"linked_reports":["dd854ff1-6cc2-38d8-a7c0-4dd4d71d8b0a"],"linked_victims":[],"linked_malwares":[],"activity_periods":null,"bank_card_issuer":null,"bank_card_system":null,"linked_campaigns":[],"account_passwords":null,"linked_identities":[],"operations_number":null,"linked_observables":[],"enrichment_services":[],"payment_system_name":null,"bank_card_valid_thru":null,"linked_threat_actors":[],"virustotal_detections":null,"linked_vulnerabilities":[]},{"id":"30a50d58-8e7b-3013-8ba1-9f94a6c77a7d","asn":null,"bik":null,"tags":[],"type":"file","alias":null,"owner":null,"score":null,"value":"onenote.exe","expire":null,"country":null,"category":null,"platform":null,"user_ids":[],"incidents":null,"is_active":true,"last_seen":null,"mask_type":null,"registrar":null,"tip_score":null,"created_at":"2024-02-06T01:05:25.392+00:00","first_seen":null,"industries":[],"updated_at":"2025-10-24T09:32:15.029+00:00","attack_type":null,"channel_ids":[],"description":"Major examples include  sqlservr.exe ,  vss.exe ,  memtas.exe ,  tomcat6.exe ,  onenote.exe , and  outlook.exe .

The termination of these services not only involves the deletion of recovery points and disabling of backups, but also simultaneously renders monitoring and security features powerless, maximizing the effects of detection evasion and analysis disruption.","entity_type":["observable"],"mitre_attrs":["defense-evasion","execution","privilege-escalation"],"modified_at":null,"collected_at":"2024-02-06T00:43:38.027+00:00","endpoint_ids":[1],"last_op_date":null,"provider_ids":[],"activity_type":[],"bank_card_cvv":null,"bank_card_dump":null,"bank_card_type":null,"linked_reports":["e07e97ed-5232-33b3-be75-5b714bf0e898","d78840a9-e567-301a-ab8b-e90dfae6f256","1f742696-692b-36d8-95a8-16774f90ca62","dd854ff1-6cc2-38d8-a7c0-4dd4d71d8b0a","9955afe3-4ec3-3723-84f8-2f6ae4b43ef6"],"linked_victims":[],"linked_malwares":[],"activity_periods":null,"bank_card_issuer":null,"bank_card_system":null,"linked_campaigns":[],"account_passwords":null,"linked_identities":[],"operations_number":null,"linked_observables":[],"enrichment_services":[],"payment_system_name":null,"bank_card_valid_thru":null,"linked_threat_actors":[],"virustotal_detections":null,"linked_vulnerabilities":[]}],"linked_threat_actors":[{"id":"bedee527-f99f-3e38-9f2a-c3996f098720","name":"DireWolf","tags":null,"goals":null,"aliases":null,"user_ids":null,"countries":null,"last_seen":null,"created_at":"2025-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","first_seen":"2025-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","industries":null,"motivation":null,"updated_at":"2025-10-24T09:32:15.029+00:00","channel_ids":null,"description":null,"modified_at":null,"collected_at":"2025-10-24T09:32:15.029+00:00","endpoint_ids":[1],"provider_ids":null,"linked_reports":["dd854ff1-6cc2-38d8-a7c0-4dd4d71d8b0a"],"linked_victims":null,"linked_malwares":null,"linked_campaigns":null,"kill_chain_phases":null,"linked_identities":null,"linked_techniques":null,"linked_observables":null,"linked_threat_actors":null,"linked_vulnerabilities":null}],"linked_vulnerabilities":null,"threat_actor_countries":null,"threat_actor_industries":null},{"id":"858b690f-e11a-342a-8643-e7fb7588ea89","name":"Investigating a Mysteriously Malformed Authenticode Signature","tags":[],"goals":null,"authors":[],"is_read":null,"sources":{"userIds":[],"channelIds":[],"endpointIds":[1],"enrichmentServices":null},"countries":[],"created_at":"2025-09-04T00:00:00+00:00","industries":[],"description":"## Introduction\n\nElastic Security Labs recently encountered a signature validation issue with one of our Windows binaries. The executable was signed using `signtool.exe` as part of our standard continuous integration (CI) process, but on this occasion, the output file failed signature validation with the following error message:\n\n> The digital signature of the object is malformed. For technical detail, see security bulletin MS13-098.\n\nThe [documentation for MS13-098][1] is vague, but it describes a potential vulnerability related to malformed Authenticode signatures. Nothing obvious had changed on our end that might explain this new error, so we needed to investigate the cause and resolve the issue.\n\nWhile we identified that this issue was affecting one of our signed Windows binaries, it could impact any binary. We are publishing this research as a reference for anyone else who may encounter the same problem in the future.\n\n## Diagnosis\n\nTo investigate further, we created a basic test program that called the Windows `WinVerifyTrust` function against the problematic executable to manually validate the signature. This revealed that it was failing with the error code `TRUST_E_MALFORMED_SIGNATURE`.\n\n`WinVerifyTrust` is a complex function, but after attaching a debugger, we discovered that the error code was being set at the following point:\n\n```\ndwReserved1 = psSipSubjectInfo->dwReserved1;\nif(!dwReserved1)\n    goto LABEL_58;\nv40 = I_GetRelaxedMarkerCheckFlags(a1, v22, (unsigned int *)&pvData);\nif(v40 < 0)\n    break;\nif(!pvData)\n    v42 = 0x80096011;    // TRUST_E_MALFORMED_SIGNATURE\n```\n\nAs shown above, if `psSipSubjectInfo->dwReserved1` is not `0`, the code calls `I_GetRelaxedMarkerCheckFlags`. If this function returns no data, the code sets the `TRUST_E_MALFORMED_SIGNATURE` error and exits.\n\nWhen stepping through the code with our problematic binary, we saw that `dwReserved1` was indeed set to `1`. Running the same test against a correctly signed binary, this value was always `0`, which skips the call to `I_GetRelaxedMarkerCheckFlags`.\n\nLooking into `I_GetRelaxedMarkerCheckFlags`, we saw that it simply checks for the presence of a specific attribute: `1.3.6.1.4.1.311.2.6.1`. A quick online search turned up very little other than the fact that this object identifier (OID) is labeled as `SpcRelaxedPEMarkerCheck`.\n\n```\n__int64 __fastcall I_GetRelaxedMarkerCheckFlags(struct _CRYPT_PROVIDER_DATA *a1, DWORD a2, unsigned int *a3)\n{\n    unsigned int v4; // ebx\n    CRYPT_PROVIDER_SGNR *ProvSignerFromChain; // rax\n    PCRYPT_ATTRIBUTE Attribute; // rax\n    signed int LastError; // eax\n    DWORD pcbStructInfo; // [rsp+60h] [rbp+18h] BYREF\n\n    pcbStructInfo = 4;\n    v4 = 0;\n    *a3 = 0;\n    ProvSignerFromChain = WTHelperGetProvSignerFromChain(a1, a2, 0, 0);\n    if(ProvSignerFromChain)\n    {\n        Attribute = CertFindAttribute(\n            \"1.3.6.1.4.1.311.2.6.1\",\n            ProvSignerFromChain->psSigner->AuthAttrs.cAttr,\n            ProvSignerFromChain->psSigner->AuthAttrs.rgAttr);\n        if(Attribute)\n        {\n            if(!CryptDecodeObject(\n                a1->dwEncoding,\n                (LPCSTR)0x1B,\n                Attribute->rgValue->pbData,\n                Attribute->rgValue->cbData,\n                0,\n                a3,\n                &pcbStructInfo))\n            {\n                return HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(GetLastError());\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    return v4;\n}\n```\n\nOur binary did not have this attribute, which caused the function to return no data and triggered the error. The function names reminded us of an optional parameter that we had previously seen in `signtool.exe`:\n\n> `/rmc` \\- Specifies signing a PE file with the relaxed marker check semantic. The flag is ignored for non-PE files. During verification, certain authenticated sections of the signature will bypass invalid PE markers check. This option should only be used after careful consideration and reviewing the details of MSRC case MS12-024 to ensure that no vulnerabilities are introduced.\n\nBased on our analysis, we suspected that re-signing the executable with the “relaxed marker check” flag (`/rmc`), and as expected, the signature was now valid.\n\n### Root cause analysis\n\nWhile the workaround above resolved our immediate problem, it clearly wasn’t the root cause. We needed to investigate further to understand why the internal `dwReserved1` flag was set in the first place.\n\nThis field is part of the `SIP_SUBJECTINFO` structure, which is [documented on MSDN][2] \\- but unfortunately, it didn’t help much in this case:\n\nTo find where this field was being set, we worked backwards and identified a point where `dwReserved1` was still `0` \\- i.e., before the flag had been set. We placed a hardware breakpoint (on write) on the `dwReserved1` field and resumed execution. The breakpoint was hit in the `SIPObjectPE_::GetMessageFromFile` function:\n\n```\n__int64 __fastcall SIPObjectPE_::GetMessageFromFile(\n    SIPObjectPE_ *this,\n    struct SIP_SUBJECTINFO_ *a2,\n    struct _WIN_CERTIFICATE *a3,\n    unsigned int a4,\n    unsigned int *a5)\n{\n    __int64 v5; // rcx\n    __int64 result; // rax\n    DWORD v8; // [rsp+40h] [rbp+8h] BYREF\n\n    v5 = *((_QWORD*)this + 1);\n    v8 = 0;\n    result = ImageGetCertificateDataEx(v5, a4, a3, a5, &v8);\n    if((_DWORD)result)\n        a2->dwReserved1 = v8;\n\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\nThis function calls the `ImageGetCertificateDataEx` API which is exported by `imagehlp.dll`. The value returned by the fifth parameter of this function is stored in `dwReserved1`. This value ultimately determines whether the PE is considered \"malformed\" in the manner we have been observing.\n\nUnfortunately, `ImageGetCertificateDataEx` is undocumented on MSDN. However, an earlier variant, `ImageGetCertificateData`, [is documented][3]:\n\n```\nBOOL IMAGEAPI ImageGetCertificateData(\n  [in]      HANDLE            FileHandle,\n  [in]      DWORD             CertificateIndex,\n  [out]     LPWIN_CERTIFICATE Certificate,\n  [in, out] PDWORD            RequiredLength\n);\n```\n\nThis function extracts the contents of the `IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_SECURITY` directory from the PE headers. Manual analysis of the `ImageGetCertificateDataEx` function showed that the first four parameters match those of `ImageGetCertificateData`, but with one additional output parameter at the end.\n\nWe wrote a simple test program that allows us to call this function and perform checks against the unknown fifth parameter:\n\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <windows.h>\n#include <imagehlp.h>\n\nint main()\n{\n    HANDLE hFile = NULL;\n    DWORD dwCertLength = 0;\n    WIN_CERTIFICATE *pCertData = NULL;\n    DWORD dwUnknown = 0;\n    BOOL (WINAPI *pImageGetCertificateDataEx)(HANDLE FileHandle, DWORD CertificateIndex, LPWIN_CERTIFICATE Certificate, PDWORD RequiredLength, DWORD *pdwUnknown);\n\n    // open target executable\n    hFile = CreateFileA(\"C:\\\\users\\\\matthew\\\\sample-executable.exe\", GENERIC_READ, FILE_SHARE_READ, NULL, OPEN_EXISTING, 0, NULL);\n    if(hFile == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE)\n    {\n        printf(\"Failed to open input file\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    // locate ImageGetCertificateDataEx export in imagehlp.dll\n    pImageGetCertificateDataEx = (BOOL(WINAPI*)(HANDLE,DWORD,LPWIN_CERTIFICATE,PDWORD,DWORD*))GetProcAddress(LoadLibraryA(\"imagehlp.dll\"), \"ImageGetCertificateDataEx\");\n    if(pImageGetCertificateDataEx == NULL)\n    {\n        printf(\"Failed to locate ImageGetCertificateDataEx\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    // get required length\n    dwCertLength = 0;\n    if(pImageGetCertificateDataEx(hFile, 0, NULL, &dwCertLength, &dwUnknown) == 0)\n    {\n        if(GetLastError() != ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER)\n        {\n            printf(\"ImageGetCertificateDataEx error (1)\\n\");\n            return 1;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // allocate data\n    printf(\"Allocating %u bytes for certificate...\\n\", dwCertLength);\n    pCertData = (WIN_CERTIFICATE*)malloc(dwCertLength);\n    if(pCertData == NULL)\n    {\n        printf(\"Failed to allocate memory\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    // read certificate data and dwUnknown flag\n    if(pImageGetCertificateDataEx(hFile, 0, pCertData, &dwCertLength, &dwUnknown) == 0)\n    {\n        printf(\"ImageGetCertificateDataEx error (2)\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    printf(\"Finished - dwUnknown: %u\\n\", dwUnknown);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nRunning this against a variety of executables confirmed our expectations: the unknown return value was `1` for our “broken” executable, and `0` for correctly signed binaries. This confirmed that the issue originated somewhere within the `ImageGetCertificateDataEx` function.\n\nFurther analysis of this function revealed that the unknown flag is being set by another internal function: `IsBufferCleanOfInvalidMarkers`.\n\n```\n...\nif(!IsBufferCleanOfInvalidMarkers(v25, v15, pdwUnknown))\n{\n    LastError = GetLastError();\n    if(!pdwUnknown)\n        goto LABEL_34;\n}\n...\n```\n\nAfter cleaning up the `IsBufferCleanOfInvalidMarkers` function, we observed the following:\n\n```\nDWORD IsBufferCleanOfInvalidMarkers(BYTE *pData, DWORD dwLength, DWORD *pdwInvalidMarkerFound)\n{\n    if(!_InterlockedCompareExchange64(&global_InvalidMarkerList, 0, 0))\n        LoadInvalidMarkers();\n\n    if(!RabinKarpFindPatternInBuffer(pData, dwLength, pdwInvalidMarkerFound))\n        return 1;\n\n    SetLastError(0x80096011); // TRUST_E_MALFORMED_SIGNATURE\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis function loads a global list of \"invalid markers\" using `LoadInvalidMarkers`, if they are not already loaded. `imagehlp.dll` contains a hardcoded default list of markers, but also checks the registry for a user-defined list at the following path:\n\n`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Cryptography\\Wintrust\\Config\\PECertInvalidMarkers`\n\nThis registry value does not appear to exist by default.\n\nThe function then performs a search across the entire PE signature data, looking for any of these markers. If a match is found, `pdwInvalidMarkerFound` is set to `1`, which maps directly to the `psSipSubjectInfo->dwReserved1` value mentioned earlier.\n\n### Dumping the invalid markers\n\nThe markers are stored in an undocumented structure inside `imagehlp.dll`. After reverse-engineering the `RabinKarpFindPatternInBuffer` function noted above, we wrote a small tool to dump the entire list of markers:\n\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <windows.h>\n\nint main()\n{\n    HMODULE hModule = LoadLibraryA(\"imagehlp.dll\");\n\n    // hardcoded address - imagehlp.dll version:\n    // 509ef25f9bac59ebf1c19ec141cb882e5c1a8cb61ac74a10a9f2bd43ed1f0585\n    BYTE *pInvalidMarkerData = (BYTE*)hModule + 0xC4D8;\n\n    BYTE *pEntryList = (BYTE*)*(DWORD64*)(pInvalidMarkerData + 20);\n    DWORD dwEntryCount = *(DWORD*)pInvalidMarkerData;\n    for(DWORD i = 0; i < dwEntryCount; i++)\n    {\n        BYTE *pCurrEntry = pEntryList + (i * 18);\n        BYTE bLength = *(BYTE*)(pCurrEntry + 9);\n        BYTE *pString = (BYTE*)*(DWORD64*)(pCurrEntry + 10);\n        for(DWORD ii = 0; ii < bLength; ii++)\n        {\n            if(isprint(pString[ii]))\n            {\n                // printable character\n                printf(\"%c\", pString[ii]);\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                // non-printable character\n                printf(\"\\\\x%02X\", pString[ii]);\n            }\n        }\n        printf(\"\\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis produced the following results:\n\n```\nPK\\x01\\x02\nPK\\x05\\x06\nPK\\x03\\x04\nPK\\x07\\x08\nRar!\\x1A\\x07\\x00\nz\\xBC\\xAF'\\x1C\n**ACE**\n!<arch>\\x0A\nMSCF\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\n\\xEF\\xBE\\xAD\\xDENull\nInitializing Wise Installation Wizard\nzlb\\x1A\nKGB_arch\nKGB2\\x00\nKGB2\\x01\nENC\\x00\ndisk%i.pak\n>-\\x1C\\x0BxV4\\x12\nISc(\nSmart Install Maker\n\\xAE\\x01NanoZip\n;!@Install@\nEGGA\nArC\\x01\nStuffIt!\n-sqx-\nPK\\x09\\x0A\n\"\\x0B\\x01\\x0B\n-lh0-\n-lh1-\n-lh2-\n-lh3-\n-lh4-\n-lh5-\n-lh6-\n-lh7-\n-lh8-\n-lh9-\n-lha-\n-lhb-\n-lhc-\n-lhd-\n-lhe-\n-lzs-\n-lz2-\n-lz3-\n-lz4-\n-lz5-\n-lz7-\n-lz8-\n<#$@@$#>\n```\n\nAs expected, this appears to be a list of magic values pertaining to old installers and compressed archive formats. This aligns with the description of [MS13-098][1], which hints towards certain installers being affected.\n\nWe suspected this was related to self-extracting executables. If an executable reads itself from disk and scans its own data for an embedded archive (e.g., a ZIP file), an attacker could potentially append malicious data to the signature section without invalidating the signature - since signature data cannot hash itself. This could potentially cause the vulnerable executable to locate the malicious data before the original data, especially if it scans backwards from the end of the file.\n\nWe later found an old [RECon talk from 2012 by Igor Glücksmann][4], which describes this exact scenario and appears to confirm our hypothesis.\n\nMicrosoft's fix involved scanning the PE signature block for known byte patterns that could indicate this type of abuse.\n\n### Investigating the false positive\n\nUpon further debugging, we discovered that the binary was being flagged due to the signature data containing the `EGGA` marker from the list above:\n\nIn the context of the list of markers above, the `EGGA` signature appears to relate to a specific header value used by an archive format called [ALZip][5]. Our code does not make any use of this file format.\n\nMicrosoft’s heuristic treated the presence of `EGGA` as evidence that malicious archive data had been embedded in the PE signature. In practice, nothing of the sort was present. The signature block itself happened to include those four bytes as part of the hashed data.\n\nCollisions like this are unusual, but page hashing (`/ph`) made it more likely. By expanding the size of the signature block, page hashing increases the surface area for coincidental matches and increases the likelihood of triggering the heuristic.\n\nThe binary didn’t contain any self-extracting routines, so the hit on `EGGA` was a false positive. In that context, the warning had no bearing on the file’s integrity. This meant it was safe to re-sign the file with `/rmc` to restore the expected validation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIt is well known that additional data can be embedded in a PE file without breaking its signature by appending it to the security block. Even some [legitimate software products][6] take advantage of this to embed user-specific metadata into signed executables. However, we were not aware that Microsoft had implemented heuristics to detect specific malicious cases of this, even though they were introduced back in 2012.\n\nThe original error message was very vague, and we were unable to find any documentation or references online that helped explain the behavior. Even searching for the associated registry value after discovering it (`PECertInvalidMarkers`) yielded zero results.\n\nWhat we uncovered is that Microsoft added heuristic scanning of signature blocks more than a decade ago to counter specific abuse cases. Those heuristics reside in a hardcoded list of “invalid markers,” many of which are tied to outdated installers and archive formats. Our binary happened to collide with one of those markers when signed with page hashing enabled, creating a validation failure with no clear documentation and no public references to the underlying registry key or detection logic.\n\nThe absence of online discussions regarding this failure mode, aside from a single unresolved [Visual Studio Developer Community post from 2018][7], made the initial diagnosis difficult. By publishing this analysis, we want to provide a technical reference point for others who may encounter the same problem. In our case, resolving the issue required deep troubleshooting that few outside this space would normally need to exercise. For teams automating code signing, the key lesson is to integrate signature validation checks early and be aware that heuristic marker detection can lead to edge-case failures.\n\n## Additional

The incident led to flights delays, cancellations, and diversions, with affected airports advising passengers to confirm travel plans.\n* Luxury brands Gucci, Balenciaga, and Alexander McQueen were [hit][3] by a data breach that resulted in the theft of personal information of potentially millions of customers worldwide. The stolen data includes names, email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, and total amount spent by each customer, but not financial details such as credit card information. The cybercriminal group Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters claimed responsibility for the attack.\n* Google has [confirmed][4] a cyber attack that resulted in hackers creating a fraudulent account within its Law Enforcement Request System platform, though no official data requests were made and no user data was accessed via the account. The incident raised concerns over potential unauthorized access and impersonation of law enforcement. The attack was claimed by Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters group.\n* Hotels in Brazil and other countries have [been][5] victims of cyber-attacks that resulted in theft of guest payment card data from front-desk systems via phishing-delivered malware. The incidents involved VenomRAT enabling credential theft, remote access, and data exfiltration, impacting travelers’ financial information across multiple regions. The campaign is attributed to the RevengeHotels group, which leveraged LLM-generated code.\n\n_Check_ _Point Harmony Endpoint provides protection against this threat_ _(RAT.Win.Venom;_ _Loader.Win.Venom)_\n\n* Venture capital firm, Insight Partners, has [been][6] a victim of a ransomware attack that resulted in data exfiltration and server encryption. The breach impacts 12,657 individuals and includes banking and tax data, personal information of current and former employees, limited partners’ data, as well as fund, management and portfolio information.\n* American jewelry company Tiffany’s has [suffered][7] a data breach that resulted in the theft of customer personal data and gift card details.

According to the company, 5% of registered firewalls had their encrypted credential-containing backup files accessed, with information that could ease exploitation of affected devices.\n\n**VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHES**\n\n* Fortra has [disclosed][9] maximum severity vulnerability CVE-2025-10035 affecting the License Servlet of Fortra’s GoAnywhere Managed File Transfer (MFT) software. The flaw results from deserialization of untrusted data, allowing remote, low-complexity command injection if the attacker can forge a valid license response signature. Successful exploitation targets externally exposed admin consoles and could enable unauthorized system access and command execution.\n* A critical authentication bypass vulnerability in the Case Theme User WordPress plugin [allowed][10] unauthenticated attackers to gain access to arbitrary user accounts, including administrators, by exploiting flaws in the Facebook social login implementation when the target’s email address is known. Mass exploitation has been observed in the wild with over 20,900 blocked attempts, as the flaw enables attackers to completely compromise vulnerable WordPress sites.\n* Google has [released][11] a security patch addressing 4 vulnerabilities affecting Chrome. Among the vulnerabilities is CVE-2025-10585, a high severity type confusion vulnerability in V8\\. According to Google, an exploit for the vulnerability already exists in the wild, confirming that it could have potentially been exploited as a zero-day.\n\n**THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORTS**\n\n* Check Point Research has [analyzed][12] a sophisticated ClickFix campaign leveraging fake job offers to deploy a Rust Loader, PureHVNC RAT, and the Sliver C2 framework across an eight-day intrusion. The investigation revealed multiple PureHVNC variants, features of PureRAT builder and PureCrypter, as well as details on PureCode, the developer of the malware.\n\n_Check_ _Point Threat Emulation and Harmony Endpoint provide protection against this threat_\n\n* Researchers [found][13] that Russian threat actors Turla and Gamaredon collaborated in Ukraine, with Gamaredon’s tools deploying and relaunching Turla’s backdoor. On the shared machines, Gamaredon deployed a wide range of tools, while Turla only deployed Kazuar v3.\n\n_Check_ _Point Threat Emulation and Harmony Endpoint provide protection against this threat_ _(APT.Win.Turla; APT.Wins.Turla.tays; APT.Wins.Turla.ta.\\*; InfoStealer.Wins.Gamaredon; InfoStealer.Win.Gamaredon; APT.Win.Gamaredon)_\n\n* Researchers [analyzed][14] Iran’s MuddyWater APT shifting from opportunistic to much more targeted spearphishing. It deploys custom malware (BugSleep, StealthCache, Phoenix), uses open-source tools, and operates across AWS, Cloudflare, DigitalOcean, OVH, M247, SEDO, and bulletproof hosts.\n\n_Check_ _Point Threat Emulation and Harmony Endpoint provide protection against this threat_ _(APT.Wins.MuddyWater; APT.Win.MuddyWater; APT.Wins.MuddyWater.ta.\\*)_\n\n* Researchers [detail][15] a recent TA415 campaign against US government and academic targets tied to US–China economic issues. The group impersonated key orgs and figures, using obfuscated Python loaders to set up VS Code Remote Tunnels for remote access and data theft.\n\n\n[1]:

Apple addressed the seventh actively exploited zero-day\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][1]  August 21, 2025 \n\n## Apple addressed a vulnerability impacting iOS, iPadOS, and macOS that it is under active exploitation in the wild.\n\nApple addressed an actively exploited zero-day, tracked as CVE-2025-43300, in iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. The vulnerability is zero-day out-of-bounds write issue that resides in the [ImageIO framework][2], an attacker could exploit it to cause memory corruption when processing a malicious image.\n\n“Processing a malicious image file may result in memory corruption.” reads the [advisory][3] published by the tech giant. “Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.”\n\nThe company fixed the problem with improved bounds checking. Apple released the following updates to fix the issue:\n\n* **[iOS 18.6.2 and iPadOS 18.6.2][3]** – iPhone XS and later, iPad Pro 13-inch, iPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 7th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later\n* **[iPadOS 17.7.10][4]** – iPad Pro 12.9-inch 2nd generation, iPad Pro 10.5-inch, and iPad 6th generation\n* **[macOS Ventura 13.7.8][5]** – Mac systems running macOS Ventura\n* **[macOS Sonoma 14.7.8][6]** – Macs systems running macOS Sonoma\n* **[macOS Sequoia 15.6.1][7]** – Macs systems running macOS Sequoia\n\nAs usual, the company did not share technical details about the attacks exploiting this vulnerability.\n\nApple’s latest update brings the total to seven zero-days patched in 2025 that were exploited in real-world attacks.\n\nThe other zero-day vulnerabilities addressed this year are [CVE-2025-24085][8], [CVE-2025-24200][9], [CVE-2025-24201][8], [CVE-2025-31200, CVE-2025-31201][10], and [CVE-2025-43200][9].\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][11]\n\n([SecurityAffairs][12] – hacking, CVE-2025-43300)\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\n[1]:

data issue affecting DELMIA Apriso from Release 2020 through Release 2025\\. An attacker could trigger the flaw to execute arbitrary code remotely.\n\nHacktron AI reported the vulnerability.\n\nAccording to [Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities][5], FCEB agencies have to address the identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect their networks against attacks exploiting the flaws in the catalog.\n\nExperts also recommend that private organizations review the [Catalog][4] and address the vulnerabilities in their infrastructure.\n\nCISA orders federal agencies to fix the vulnerabilities by October 2, 2025.\n\nLast week, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) [added][6] Sitecore, Android, and Linux to its [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog][4].\n\nBelow are the descriptions for these flaws:\n\n* [CVE-2025-53690][7] Sitecore Multiple Products Deserialization of Untrusted Data Vulnerability\n* [CVE-2025-38352][8] Linux Kernel

Severe Hikvision HikCentral product flaws: What You Need to Know\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][1]  September 04, 2025 \n\n## Hikvision HikCentral flaw allows unauthenticated users to gain admin rights, risking full control over configs, logs, and critical monitoring.\n\nSecurity researchers warn of [three vulnerabilities impacting Hikvision HikCentral][2], which is a centralized management software used across many industries for video surveillance, access control, and integrated security operations.\n\nThe three vulnerabilities are:\n\n* [CVE-2025-39245][3] – Base score: 4.7 – There is a CSV Injection Vulnerability in some HikCentral Master Lite versions. This could allow an attacker to inject executable commands via malicious CSV data.\n* [CVE-2025-39246][4] – Base score: 5.3 – There is an Unquoted Service Path Vulnerability in some HikCentral FocSign versions. This could allow an authenticated user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.\n* [CVE-2025-39247][5] – Base score: 8.6 – There is an Access Control Vulnerability in some HikCentral Professional versions. This could allow an unauthenticated user to obtain the admin permission.\n\nOne of them was rated as high severity, and it stands out because it allows an unauthenticated user to escalate privileges and ultimately gain administrative access to the system. When attackers can elevate their privileges without even logging in, they essentially hold the keys to the entire environment. That creates a direct path to manipulating configurations, tampering with logs, or even shutting down critical monitoring functions.\n\nHikCentral serves as the backbone for many organizations’ security infrastructure. Companies rely on it to manage surveillance cameras, control building access, and integrate data from multiple devices into one cohesive platform. An attacker can exploit the privilege escalation flaw to take over these functions. Once an attacker elevates privileges, they can act as an administrator, install malware, create hidden accounts, or exfiltrate sensitive information. Imagine a scenario where an attacker disables cameras during a physical intrusion, unlocks restricted doors, or modifies audit trails to hide evidence. This scenario poses a serious threat to the safety and business continuity of the impacted organizations.\n\nThe affected versions include:\n\nOrganizations running these builds should treat this disclosure as a wake-up call.\n\nIn HikCentral’s case, the risk increases because attackers don’t even need to authenticate first. They can approach the system anonymously, exploit the flaw, and instantly gain elevated control. This bypass undermines all trust in standard authentication processes.\n\nThe Chinese vendor has already released [**guidance**][2], and the best step forward involves applying updates immediately. HikCentral administrators should:\n\n* **Harden the environment** while applying the update: limit external exposure\n* **Check the version number** of their deployment. If it falls within the affected ranges, it requires attention.\n* **Download and install the latest patches** provided by Hikvision in their official security bulletin.\n\n[Pierluigi

Critical flaw SessionReaper in Commerce and Magento platforms lets attackers hijack customer accounts\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][1]  September 10, 2025 \n\n## Adobe fixed a critical flaw in its Commerce and Magento Open Source platforms that allows an attacker to take over customer accounts.\n\nAdobe addressed a critical vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-54236 (aka SessionReaper, CVSS score of 9.1) in its Commerce and Magento Open Source platforms. The vulnerability is an improper input validation flaw.\n\n_“The bug, dubbed SessionReaper and assigned CVE-2025-54236, allows customer account takeover and unauthenticated remote code execution under certain conditions.” [reported][2] cybersecurity firm Sansec. “SessionReaper is one of the more severe Magento vulnerabilities in its history, comparable to [Shoplift][3] (2015), [Ambionics SQLi][4] (2019), [TrojanOrder][5] (2022) and [CosmicSting][6] (2024). Each time, thousands of stores got hacked, sometimes within hours of the flaw being published.”_\n\nAn attacker can exploit this vulnerability to take over customer accounts.\n\n_“A potential attacker could take over customer accounts in Adobe Commerce through the Commerce REST API.” [reads][7] the advisory._\n\nAdobe is not aware any attacks in the wild exploiting this vulnerability.\n\nThe vulnerability impacts the following products and versions:\n\nAdobe Commerce (all deployment methods):\n\n* 2.4.9-alpha2 and earlier\n* 2.4.8-p2 and earlier\n* 2.4.7-p7 and earlier\n* 2.4.6-p12 and earlier\n* 2.4.5-p14 and earlier\n* 2.4.4-p15 and earlier\n\nAdobe Commerce B2B:\n\n* 1.5.3-alpha2 and earlier\n* 1.5.2-p2 and earlier\n* 1.4.2-p7 and earlier\n* 1.3.4-p14 and earlier\n* 1.3.3-p15 and earlier\n\nMagento Open Source:\n\n* 2.4.9-alpha2 and earlier\n* 2.4.8-p2 and earlier\n* 2.4.7-p7 and earlier\n* 2.4.6-p12 and earlier\n* 2.4.5-p14 and earlier\n\nCustom Attributes Serializable module:\n\nversions 0.1.0 to 0.4.0\n\nThe researcher [blaklis][8] reported the vulnerability to the software giant.\n\nThe SessionReaper flaw, similar to last year’s [CosmicSting][9], enables RCE via Magento’s REST API using a malicious session and a deserialization bug, with risk across storage types.\n\n_“Our security team successfully reproduced one possible avenue to exploit SessionReaper, but there are likely multiple vectors. While we cannot disclose technical details that could aid attackers, the vulnerability follows a familiar pattern from last year’s [CosmicSting][6] attack. The attack combines a malicious session with a nested deserialization bug in Magento’s REST API.” continues Sansec. “The specific remote code execution vector appears to require file-based session storage.”_\n\nSansec advises all merchants, including those using Redis or database sessions, to act immediately due to multiple exploit paths for this vulnerability.\n\n[Pierluigi

An attacker can exploit the issue to achieve unauthorized access to the devices.\n\nSonicWall addressed the critical flaw in its firewalls in August 2024, and the US CISA [added][5] it to its [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog][6] in September 2024.\n\nIn August 2025, SonicWall [investigated claims of a zero-day][7] being used in ransomware attacks but found no evidence of any new vulnerability in its products.\n\nSonicWall launched the investigation after a surge in [Akira ransomware attacks][8] targeting Gen 7 firewalls with SSLVPN enabled. The company worked to determine if the incidents stem from an existing flaw or a newly discovered vulnerability.\n\nSonicWall later confirmed that there’s no zero-day involved in recent ransomware attacks, but rather the exploitation of a known flaw, [CVE-2024-40766][9]. While many systems have since been patched, attackers can still access them if credentials weren’t changed. Fewer than 40 related incidents are under investigation by SonicWall, mostly tied to firewall migrations.\n\n_“We now have high confidence that the recent SSLVPN activity is **not connected to a zero-day vulnerability**. Instead, there is a significant correlation with threat activity related to CVE-2024-40766, which was previously disclosed and documented in our public advisory [SNWLID-2024-0015][10].” reads the [advisory][11] published by the security vendor._ \n\n_“We are currently investigating less than 40 incidents related to this cyber activity. Many of the incidents relate to migrations from Gen 6 to Gen 7 firewalls, where local user passwords were carried over during the migration and not reset. Resetting passwords was a critical step outlined in the [original advisory][10]. “_\n\nSonicWall issued new guidance on the SSLVPN Default Users Group risk, which may grant unauthorized access in certain LDAP setups. Rapid7 also found threat actors abusing the Virtual Office Portal to configure MFA/TOTP with exposed credentials. Evidence suggests Akira ransomware is exploiting a mix of these flaws for attacks.\n\n_“Evidence collected during Rapid7’s investigations suggests that the Akira group is potentially utilizing a combination of all three of these security risks to gain unauthorized access and conduct ransomware operations.” continues the report._\n\nRapid7 urges SonicWall users to secure accounts, enable MFA, fix SSLVPN Default Groups risk, restrict and monitor the Virtual Office Portal, and apply security patches.\n\nThe [Akira ransomware][12] has been active since March 2023, the threat actors behind the malware claim to have already hacked multiple organizations in multiple industries, including education, finance, and real estate. Like other ransomware gangs, the group has developed a Linux encryptor to target VMware ESXi servers.\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][13]\n\n([SecurityAffairs][14] – hacking, Akira

to this week’s edition of the Threat Source newsletter. \n\nI took a two-week vacation (thanks to Bill for covering my author shift last week) and made the deliberate choice to leave my laptop behind. No emails, IMs, no IT at all. Thank you, European work culture! It was a complete break. \n\nWell, almost. \n\nThe weather didn’t always cooperate, so instead of freezing on a beach, I found myself catching up on TV — mostly news and a few series. But wherever I clicked, I just couldn’t escape the daily dose of AI. What can we do about invasive mosquitos? Ask AI. Government doesn’t move the needle? Ask AI. Want the weather forecast? AI, obviously. There are countless ads with people asking AI whether or not to wear a jacket “because it might rain.” Even with your favorite TV shows, gone are the days when the hoodied hacker sits in front of a black terminal with green text running a dangerous (haha) ping or nmap. Now, they're writing lines like, “Did you try breaking the firewall with our latest AI algorithm, bro?” \n\nComing back to work and catching up on our industry news, I almost expected AI to be dominating the headlines. But it wasn't, and neither was ransomware. Instead, they were all about breaches. Many — but not all — reports referenced compromised OAuth tokens linked to Salesloft’s Drift integration, with a notable number of high-profile victims. Sure, this isn’t a scientific or qualitative analysis (ransomware isn’t disappearing anytime soon), but the reporting and the headlines have definitely shifted from one to the other. \n\nLooking past the buzzwords and catchphrases, the headlines really boiled down to two main themes: supply chain and identity attacks. In a SaaS world, I think it’s time to rethink their definitions and priority levels. \n\nWhy? First, supply chain attacks aren’t limited to hardware or [software][1] anymore. We need to consider the datapath (or where data possibly is processed) as a key part of the supply chain. \n\nSecond, identity attacks don’t just target users; interconnected applications are increasingly at risk, too. I’m not saying we can ignore the users, especially with [current reporting][2] that it started with access through a GitHub account or software vulnerabilities in our “classic” applications, but we absolutely need to broaden our focus. Last week’s headlines made that clear. \n\n## The one big thing \n\nCisco Talos’ [latest blog post][3] details the Cyber Threat Intelligence Capability Maturity Model (CTI-CMM), a framework that helps organizations assess and enhance their cyber threat intelligence programs across 11 key domains. By outlining clear maturity levels and improvement cycles, CTI-CMM can help your team benchmark your current capabilities and develop a strategy for continuous (and practical) growth. \n\n### Why do I care? \n\nUnderstanding and improving your CTI program’s maturity can help your organization better anticipate, detect, and respond to cyber threats, no matter your budget or staffing level. It also makes the security investments you do have more effective, and ensure your team’s efforts are aligned with business priorities. \n\n### So now what? \n\nCheck out the [CTI-CMM framework][3] to assess where your organization stands, identify gaps and opportunities, and create a roadmap to practical improvements for your organization.\n\n## Top security headlines of the week \n\n**Huge NPM supply chain attack goes out with whimper**   \nA supply chain attack involving multiple NPM packages had the potential to be one of the most impactful security incidents in recent memory, but such fears seemingly have proved unrealized.

This can cause crashes, data corruption, or enable exploits like remote code execution. Common in C/C++ programs, UAFs are frequent in browsers and OS software handling manual memory management.\n\nThe researcher Looben Yang reported the vulnerability to Google on August 22, 2025.  \nGoogle rolled out a [Chrome update][2] that addressed this issue and another bug, tracked as CVE-2025-10201\\. CVE-2025-10201 is an inappropriate implementation in Mojo, which is an inter-process communication (IPC) framework used by Google Chrome.\n\nResearchers Sahan Fernando and an anonymous expert reported the flaw CVE-2025-10201 and earned $30000 from Google for reporting this issue.\n\nThe Chrome update is being released as version 140.0.7339.127/.128 for Windows, 140.0.7339.132/.133 for macOS, and 140.0.7339.127 for Linux.\n\nGoogle did not reveal if any of these vulnerabilities have been actively exploited in attacks in the wild.\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][3]\n\n([SecurityAffairs][4] – hacking,

Attackers abuse ConnectWise ScreenConnect to drop AsyncRAT\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][1]  September 11, 2025 \n\n## Hackers exploit ConnectWise ScreenConnect to drop AsyncRAT via scripted loaders, stealing data and persisting with a fake Skype updater.\n\nLevelBlue researchers warn of a campaign abusing [ConnectWise ScreenConnect][2] to deploy [AsyncRAT][3]. Attackers use VBScript/PowerShell loaders and achieve persistence via a fake Skype updater.\n\nConnectWise ScreenConnect is a remote desktop and remote support software designed to enable secure, real-time access to computers and devices from anywhere. IT professionals, managed service providers (MSPs), and businesses widely utilize it to troubleshoot, maintain, and remotely manage endpoints.\n\nThe attack started with a compromised ScreenConnect client, threat actors initiated an interactive session through a malicious domain (relay.shipperzone\\[.\\]online) linked to unauthorized ScreenConnect deployments.\n\nA VBScript triggered PowerShell commands that fetched two payloads, stored them in the public folder, and executed them directly in memory. The attackers decoded and ran .NET assemblies directly in memory instead of saving executables to disk, using a classic fileless malware trick that makes detection and defense much harder.\n\n_“The two payloads, logs.ldk and logs.ldr, were downloaded from a remote server. These files were written to the C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\ directory and loaded into memory using reflection. The script converted the first-stage payload (logs.ldk) into a byte array and passed the second (logs.ldr) directly to the Main() method. The script retrieves encoded data from the web, decodes it in-memory, and invokes a method in a dynamically loaded .NET assembly.” reads the report published by LevelBlue._\n\n_“This technique exemplifies fileless malware: no executable is written to disk, and all malicious logic is executed in-memory.”_\n\nObfuscator.dll is the first in-memory stage of the AsyncRAT infection chain. It launches execution, sets up persistence via a fake “Skype Updater,” and disables defenses like AMSI and ETW. The malware includes It three core classes to handle initialization, dynamic payload loading, and anti-analysis tactics, ensuring stealth and preparing the system for the main payload.\n\nAsyncClient.exe is the core C2 engine of the AsyncRAT attack chain. It decrypts config with AES-256, connects to C2 servers, and parses commands via a custom protocol. The malware gathers system and security details, monitors user activity with a keylogger, and exfiltrates sensitive data like browser extensions. The malware maintains persistence via scheduled tasks using the CreateLoginTask() function seen in Obfuscator.dll or redundantly recreated from AsyncClient.\n\n_“Fileless malware continues to evade modern defenses due to its stealthy nature and reliance on legitimate system tools for execution.” concludes the report. “This approach bypasses traditional disk-based detection by operating in memory, making these threats harder to detect, analyze, and eradicate.”_\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][4]\n\n([SecurityAffairs][5] – hacking, AsyncRAT)\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\n[1]:

They have been highly active in their sophisticated spear-phishing campaigns employing various malware strains, social engineering techniques, and cloud-based C2 infrastructures. They have been combining various infiltration techniques such as LNK and PowerShell-based loaders, steganography (JPEG image concealment), and fileless techniques to distribute RATs and data exfiltration malware. They have also been continuously exploiting legitimate platforms such as GitHub, pCloud, Dropbox, Yandex, and PubNub as their C2 servers. Their technical diversity and expansion of their attack targets have been clearly visible, including cryptocurrency wallet and credential theft, attacks against macOS users, and the deployment of Rust-based backdoors and ransomware.\n\n### Kimsuky\n\nThe North Korea-linked APT group Kimsuky impersonated a South Korean media company’s employee to launch a spear-phishing attack targeting a policy research institute.

has been continuously launching ransomware attacks against companies in various industries and countries, including South Korea. This post provides a technical analysis on the characteristics, encryption methods, and reasons why BlackNevas encrypts files in a way that makes them impossible to decrypt. It is hoped that this post will provide insights for defending against similar threats in the future.\n\n# \n\n# 1\\. Overview\n\n## 1.1\\. BlackNevas\n\nThe BlackNevas ransomware group first appeared in November 2024 and has since been continuously attacking various businesses and critical infrastructure organizations in Asia, North America, and Europe. Like other ransomware groups, BlackNevas encrypts files on infected systems, steals sensitive data from affected companies, and threatens to leak the data if the ransom is not paid. The group’s targets are spread across multiple regions, with a particular focus on the Asia-Pacific region (50%). Major targets include countries in Southeast Asia and East Asia such as Japan, Thailand, and Korea. In Europe, the group targets countries in Western Europe and the Baltic Sea region, including the UK, Italy, and Lithuania. In North America, the group has targeted Connecticut in the United States.\n\nThe BlackNevas ransomware does not officially operate under the Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model. They threaten victims by claiming that the breach of their data will be handed over to their own data leak site (DLS) and affiliated partners. The threat actors encrypt files using a combination of AES (symmetric key) and RSA (public key). The extension “.-encrypted” is added to the encrypted files.\n\nThe ransomware distributed by the BlackNevas group does not perform any additional network communication after encrypting files. The ransom note instructs victims to contact them via email or Telegram to decrypt the encrypted data.\n\n  \n**Figure 1\\. Threat actor’s Telegram address within the ransom note**\n\n# 2\\. Analysis\n\n## 2.1\\. Initial Routine\n\nThe BlackNevas ransomware did not include anti-debugging techniques or anti-sandbox evasion features. Instead, it supports multiple arguments, and the details of these arguments are shown in Table 1 below.\n\n| **Argument**   | **Behavior**                                              |\n| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |\n| /allow\\_system | Encrypts system path                                      |\n| /fast          | Encrypts only 1% of the entire file size                  |\n| /full          | Encrypts entire file                                      |\n| /path          | Specifies the encrypted path                              |\n| /debug         | Ouputs execution logs when encrypted                      |\n| /stealth       | Changes extension upon encryption and creates ransom note |\n| /shdwn         | Terminates system after file encryption                   |\n\n**Table 1\\. Behavior according to the parameter value**  \n\n  \nAs shown in Table 1, the BlackNevas ransomware outputs its execution history via the “/debug” argument, which also reveals the ransomware’s version information. Additionally, when neither the “/fast” nor “/full” argument is specified, only the first 10% of the file’s full size is encrypted from the beginning.\n\n  \n**Figure 2\\. Version information output through the “/debug” argument**  \n\n## 2.2\\. Preparation for Encryption\n\nBlackNevas ransomware does not encrypt paths that are inaccessible during the encryption process or paths that contain the string “system32” or “windows”. All other accessible paths are subject to encryption. Typically, other ransomware operate based on a predefined list of paths to exclude from encryption. In contrast, BlackNevas ransomware features a characteristic in which it conditionally checks path strings at runtime to determine whether they should be excluded from encryption.\n\n  \n**Figure 3\\. Code to check the exclusion path of encryption**\n\nTo prevent the system from being damaged by encrypting key files, specific extensions and files are excluded from encryption. The files excluded from encryption are “NTUSER.DAT” and the ransom note “how\\_to\\_decrypt.txt”, while the extensions excluded from encryption are shown in Table 2 below.\n\n| **File extensions excluded from encryption**                             |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| sys, dll, exe, log, bmp, vmem, vswp, vmxf, vmsd, scoreboard, nvram, vmss |\n\n**Table 2\\. File extensions excluded from encryption**\n\n## 2.3\\. File Encryption\n\nThere are two types of file name changes when encrypting files: “random name.random name.-encrypted” and “trial-recovery.random name.random name.-encrypted”. The Table 3 below shows the extensions that include “trial-recovery” in the file name. In other cases, the file name is changed to the “random name.random name.-encrypted” format. As can be inferred from the file name, the type with the “trial-recovery” prefix is likely given to certain files as a demonstration to the victims to show that the files can actually be decrypted.\n\n| **Extensions that use “trial-recovery” in the file name** |\n| --------------------------------------------------------- |\n| doc, docx, hwp, jpg, pdf, png, rtf, txt                   |\n\n**Table 3\\. Extensions that use “trial-recovery” in the filename**\n\nOnce the check of the exclusion path, file, and extension is completed, it checks whether the file is already encrypted before encrypting it. Typically, most ransomware use the method of designating the extension of files that have already been encrypted as an exception extension to determine the infection status. However, BlackNevas ransomware does not use this method. Instead, it compares specific data values to determine whether a file has been encrypted.\n\nAs shown in Figure 4 below, the 8-byte value at the end of the original file before encryption is checked (highlighted in red) to determine if it is the “E” or “R” type. “E” refers to the type where the file extension is changed after encryption, and “R” refers to the type where the file name is changed to “trial-recovery”. The same 8-byte value at the end of the encrypted file is then checked, which indicates the size of the additional data added to the original file size.\n\nUpon completion of the infection check, the file is encrypted using an AES symmetric key as mentioned in the overview. The generated AES key is then encrypted with an RSA public key and inserted at the end of the file. As a result, there are no clues left behind in the local environment that can be used to decrypt the file.\n\n  \n**Figure 4\\. Data structure added after file encryption**\n\n## 2.4\\. Ransom Note\n\nThe following is a screen captured after being infected by BlackNevas ransomware. The desktop background has not been changed.\n\n  \n**Figure 5\\. Test environment after encryption is complete and the desktop is changed**\n\nThe ransom note is created under the name “how\\_to\\_decrypt.txt”. As the ransom note is created in all folders except for the exclusion folder, the ransom note is created in all folders present in the system. The note claims that the threat actor is a professional in file encryption and industrial espionage activities. It also includes a blackmail message threatening to leak the victim’s data to their partners, post it on a blog, or put it up for auction if a decryption negotiation is not made within 7 days.\n\n  \n**Figure 6\\. Ransom note (how\\_to\\_decrypt.txt)**  \n\n# 3\\. Conclusion\n\nThe number of companies suffering ransomware attacks through the DLS of the BlackNevas group is on the rise. This group is distributed globally and has been particularly targeting the Asia-Pacific region (50%). The primary targets are countries in Southeast and East Asia, such as Japan, Thailand, and Korea. In Europe, the group has been targeting countries along the Baltic Sea, such as the UK, Italy, and Lithuania. In North America, the group has been targeting Connecticut in the US. As described in this report, the ransomware encrypts files using an AES symmetric key, and then encrypts the AES key with an RSA public key. Therefore, unless the RSA algorithm itself is broken, there is no possibility of decryption. For this reason, companies are strongly advised to strictly adhere to the following response guide to protect and stably operate their key assets.\n\n# 4\\.

The ransomware is particularly notable for its pro-Russia nature, as it primarily targets anti-Russian countries, making it a geopolitically significant cyber threat. This post provides a technical analysis of the internal workings, encryption structure, and reasons why decryption is not possible in order to offer insights for preparing against similar threats in the future.\n\n**1\\. CyberVolk Ransomware Group**  \nCyberVolk is a ransomware group that emerged in May 2024\\. It is believed to be pro-Russia and targets public institutions of countries deemed hostile to Russia’s interests. The group recently claimed to have attacked major infrastructure facilities and scientific institutions in Japan, France, and the UK. The group uses Telegram as its main communication channel.  \n\n  \n**Figure 1\\. CyberVolk group logo**\n\n**2\\. Analysis Details**\n\n  \n**Figure 2\\. CyberVolk execution flow**\n\nWhen the CyberVolk ransomware is initially executed with normal user privileges, it restarts the ransomware with administrator privileges. It excludes certain items from encryption, such as files and directories that may cause issues in the system when encrypted. It also excludes encryption targets that contain the strings shown in Table 1 in their paths or filenames. For the excluded extensions, the CyberVolk ransomware encrypts files without distinguishing the extension, except for the extension that is changed during encryption. This prevents re-encrypting files that are already encrypted.\n\n| Strings related to encryption exclusion targets |\n| ----------------------------------------------- |\n| Windows                                         |\n| Program Files                                   |\n| ProgramData                                     |\n\n**Table 1\\. Strings related to exclusion from encryption**\n\n| Extensions Excluded from Encryption |\n| ----------------------------------- |\n| .CyberVolk                          |\n\n**Table 2\\. Extensions excluded from encryption**  \n\nThe algorithms used for encryption are the symmetric key encryption methods AES and ChaCha20-Poly1305\\. The key used for encryption is generated before the main function starts, and all files are encrypted using the same symmetric key.\n\n  \n**Figure 3\\. Symmetric key used in the encryption algorithm**\n\nDuring encryption, a 12-byte random value known as a nonce (number used once) is generated using the crypto\\_rand\\_Read() function. The nonce is a unique, one-time value that prevents the encryption algorithm from producing the same output for the same input. The file content is then encrypted using AES-256 GCM mode. The encrypted file content is then further encrypted using ChaCha20-Poly1305.\n\n  \n**Figure 4\\. Encryption with AES-256 GCM mode**\n\nUpon examining the structure of the encrypted file as described above, only the encrypted file content and the authentication tag generated by the ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption are present.\n\n  \n**Figure 5\\. Structural changes between the original file and the encrypted file**\n\nThe ransom note is named READMENOW.txt, and it is only created in the path where the CyberVolk ransomware is executed after file encryption is completed.\n\n  \n**Figure 6\\. The created ransom note**\n\nAfter changing the desktop background and running the ransom note, a message is displayed in the prompt window, saying that the files have been encrypted and users have three attempts to enter the decryption key. The decryption key is hard-coded into the file, and entering the correct key triggers the decryption logic. First, an attempt is made to decrypt the contents of the file encrypted with ChaCha20-Poly1305\\. However, there is an issue with this process, and the decryption is not successful. During decryption, the correct Nonce value used in encryption must be used. However, an incorrect Nonce value is used in this case, causing the decryption to fail.\n\n  \n**Figure 7\\. Decryption of the file**\n\n**3\\. Conclusion**  \nThe CyberVolk ransomware group first emerged in May 2024 and has a pro-Russian inclination. They target public agencies of countries with a pro-Russian inclination and inflict damages by using their own ransomware variants. As described in this report, the ransomware uses the SHA-256 algorithm to encrypt a string that is hard-coded in the file, and this encrypted value is used as a symmetric key. The file content is then encrypted with the AES and ChaCha20-Poly1305 algorithms.\n\nThe nonce value used for encryption is different for each file and is generated randomly. However, since this value is not stored in the encrypted file, it cannot be decrypted. In response to this incident, companies are advised to back up important data to an offsite location separated from the service network to protect and operate key assets securely. They should also implement access controls for the backup repository and conduct regular recovery drills. It is essential to take strategic measures to ensure the security and recoverability of the backup system, going beyond simple data backup.\n\n**4\\. AhnLab’s Response**\n\n**4.1\\.

Note #3634501 addresses an insecure deserialization issue, tracked as CVE-2025-42944 (CVSS score of 10.0), in the RMI-P4 module, enabling unauthenticated RCE via malicious payloads. \n\n_“The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands by submitting malicious payload to an open port. A successful exploit can lead to full compromise of the application.” reads the [advisory][2] published by Onapsis. “As a temporary workaround, customers should add P4 port filtering at the ICM level to prevent unknown hosts from connecting to the P4 port. “_\n\nNote #3643865 fixes an insecure file operations flaw, tracked as CVE-2025-42922 (CVSS score of CVSS 9.9), where non-admin users could upload and execute arbitrary files, risking full system compromise.\n\nSAP also released HotNews Note #3302162 to fix a Directory Traversal flaw, tracked as CVE-2023-27500, in NetWeaver AS ABAP (CVSS score of 9.6). Released in March 2023, it’s now updated with new fixes.\n\nThe fourth HotNews issued by SAP addressed a missing authentication check, tracked as CVE-2025-42958 (CVSS score 9.1), in SAP NetWeaver BC-OP-AS4.\n\nThe remaining security notes resolve high, medium- and low-severity issues.\n\nIt’s unclear if any of these vulnerabilities are being exploited in attacks in the wild.\n\n[Pierluigi

Executive Summary\n\nCYFIRMA has identified an ongoing cyber-espionage campaign orchestrated by APT36 (Transparent Tribe), a Pakistan-based threat actor with a sustained focus on Indian Government entities. This operation reflects the group’s increasing sophistication and flexibility; leveraging tailored malware, aimed at Boss operating systems.\n\nInitial access is achieved through spear phishing emails. Linux BOSS environments are targeted via weaponized .desktop shortcut files that, once opened, download and execute malicious payloads.\n\nAPT36’s capability to customize its delivery mechanisms according to the victim’s operating environment thereby increases its chances of success while maintaining persistent access to critical government infrastructure and evading traditional security controls.\n\n## Introduction\n\nNation-state threat actors continue to evolve their tactics to exploit vulnerabilities across diverse operating environments, posing a significant challenge to government defenses. APT36 (also known as Transparent Tribe), a Pakistan-based adversarial group, remains actively engaged in cyber espionage operations against Indian Government institutions. Recent CYFIRMA observations reveal a marked increase in the group’s sophistication, as it deploys customized malware tailored specifically for the Linux BOSS operating system. By adopting a dual-platform delivery strategy, APT36 seeks to maximize its reach and ensure sustained, covert access to critical government infrastructure while circumventing conventional security mechanisms.\n\n| **Target Technologies**     | Windows and BOSS Operating System                                                                                                          |\n| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **Threat Type**             | Phishing Campaign                                                                                                                          |\n| **Written In**              | GO Language                                                                                                                                |\n| **File Types**              | ELF (Executable and Linkable format)                                                                                                       |\n| **Key Malware Identifiers** | Meeting\\_Ltr\\_ID1543ops.pdf.desktop and Meeting\\_Ltr\\_ID1543ops.pdf-.elf                                                                   |\n| **Observed First**          | 2025-08-01                                                                                                                                 |\n| **Impact**                  | Data Exfiltration                                                                                                                          |\n| **MD5 Hashes**              | Meeting\\_Ltr\\_ID1543ops.pdf.desktop “10b7139952e3daae8f9d7ee407696ccf” Meeting\\_Ltr\\_ID1543ops.pdf-.elf “5bfeeae3cc9386513dc7c301c61e67a7” |\n\n## Malware Campaign Attack Flow\n\nIn this campaign, the group distributes an Archive file named “**Meeting\\_Notice\\_Ltr\\_ID1543ops.pdf\\_.zip**”.\n\nWhen opened, it contains a .desktop file named “**Meeting\\_Ltr\\_ID1543ops.pdf.desktop**” (Linux shortcut file). \n\nThe .desktop file has been flagged as highly malicious on VirusTotal, with multiple antivirus engines consistently identifying it as associated with malware or unauthorized execution behavior.\n\n### “.desktop” shortcut file working\n\nThe “.desktop” file shown is crafted to masquerade as an ordinary PDF shortcut but contains a chain of commands embedded in its **Exec=** line that are executed automatically and sequentially as soon as the file is launched. This enables the attacker to perform covert actions while keeping the victim unaware.\n\nThe Exec field launches a Bash shell using **bash -c**, allowing several commands to be chained in a single line. The sequence begins by generating a temporary filename inside **/tmp**, incorporating a timestamp to avoid detection and prevent naming conflicts. Using **curl -s**, the script silently retrieves a hex-encoded file (**Mt\\_dated\\_29.txt**) from an attacker-controlled server. \n\nInstead of saving it directly, the download is piped through **xxd -r -p**, which converts the hexadecimal text into raw binary form. This binary is written directly to the temporary file path.\n\nIf this download and conversion succeed, the script uses **chmod +x** to make the temporary file executable and immediately runs it in the background. At this stage, the malicious payload (whose content is unknown to the user) is now active in the system.\n\nTo divert suspicion, the script then launches Firefox in the background and opens a Google Drive link containing a harmless PDF. This acts as a visual decoy, leading the victim to believe that they have simply viewed a document, all while the malicious binary continues its execution unseen.\n\n**Type=Application** tells the system to treat the entry as an executable program rather than a document, ensuring that its payload is run rather than simply opened. \n\n**Terminal=false** prevents any terminal window from appearing on-screen, letting all actions execute silently. \n\n**Icon=application-pdf** assigns a familiar PDF icon to the shortcut, enhancing its disguise as a legitimate document. Together, these attributes support a classic social-engineering rule.\n\n**Enabling X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true** ensures that the file automatically runs every time the user logs in, granting the attacker persistence on the system. Combined with stealthy execution and a convincing disguise, this multistage mechanism allows the attacker to deliver and run malware, maintain access, and potentially perform further malicious operations without triggering immediate detection by the user.\n\n**Domain Analysis**  \nDomain “**securestore\\[.\\]cv**” has been identified as a part of the malicious infrastructure actively leveraged in cyber espionage campaigns attributed to the APT36 (Transparent Tribe) threat group, which is assessed to be operating out of Pakistan.\n\nThe domain **securestore\\[.\\]cv** has been observed communicating with the file **Meeting\\_Ltr\\_ID1543ops.pdf.desktop**.\n\nThe domain **securestore\\[.\\]cv**, registered via Namecheap on **27 July 2025** and currently only **23 days old**, warrants scrutiny as potential malicious infrastructure, due to its recent creation and associated registrar attributes.\n\nThese campaigns resemble previously observed Linux-based attack patterns, in which **.desktop** files are weaponized to mimic legitimate government or defense-related documents. Upon execution, the files establish connections with newly registered domains linked to APT36 infrastructure, such as “**securestore\\[.\\]cv**” to download and execute additional malicious payloads.\n\n### Technical Analysis of ELF Malicious Files\n\n#### Static Analysis\n\nELF Header: Starts with the magic bytes **7F 45 4C 46** (representing “**.ELF**” in ASCII), indicating it is an **Executable and Linkable Format** file.\n\nThe file was identified as an ELF 64-bit LSB executable for x86-64 (version 1, SYSV), statically linked. It exhibits an unusually large section header offset of 9,626,443, which may indicate corruption or malicious tampering.\n\nThis ELF executable file has an entry point at 0x477c00\\. It includes 6 program headers (56 bytes each) starting at byte 64, and 25 section headers (64 bytes each) starting at byte 400\\. The section name table is at index 22\\. The ELF header is 64 bytes, with no special flags set.\n\nThree LOAD segments include readable-executable code, read-only data, and a read-write segment with a larger memory than file size, suggesting unpacked or runtime data typical in malware. The GNU\\_STACK segment’s read-write permission also poses potential security concerns.\n\nThe section headers are suspicious due to missing section names, which are uncommon in normal binaries and often used to hide malicious code. Several sections have unusual flags, zero addresses, or irregular sizes and alignments. Large NOBITS sections with no file offset may be used to load hidden data at runtime, indicating possible obfuscation or packing typical of malware.\n\n#### Command and Control\n\nThe presence of “**http://modgovindia\\[.\\]space:4000**” as both a string and a hex value in the malware file indicates a hardcoded command-and-control (C2) server address, embedded to ensure persistent communication for receiving commands, delivering payloads, or exfiltrating data.\n\n### Dynamic Analysis\n\nUpon execution, the malware enables the **system-update.service** for the current user, ensuring it is automatically started during future user-level systemd sessions.\n\nThe malware establishes persistence by quietly inserting a cron job that executes the hidden payload ‘**.config/systemd/systemd-update**’ on every system reboot. This ensures the malicious code automatically restarts after system reboots or process termination.\n\nSubsequently, the malware established command-and-control (C2) communication with the domain “**modgovindia\\[.\\]space**”, which resolves to the IP address **45\\[.\\]141\\[.\\]58\\[.\\]199**, over port **4000**.\n\nThe observed activity involves low-level socket operations used by malware to perform DNS queries for command-and-control (C2) communication. It creates a non-blocking UDP socket, enables broadcast, and connects to the local DNS resolver at **127.0.0.53:53**. Using **epoll** for efficient event handling, the malware sends DNS queries, such as for the suspicious domain **modgovindia\\[.\\]space**, and attempts to read responses non-blockingly. **Futex** system calls indicate synchronization in a multithreaded context. This behavior points to DNS-based reconnaissance or communication with a malicious server as part of a C2 infrastructure.\n\nThe malware attempts to transmit harvested data to the attacker’s infrastructure, indicating the presence of an active bidirectional command-and-control (C2) channel that facilitates both the retrieval of instructions and the exfiltration of information.\n\n**Domain Analysis**  \nThe domain “**modgovindia\\[.\\]space**” has been flagged as malicious by multiple detection engines and is assessed to be associated with **APT36** activity.\n\nThe domain **modgovindia\\[.\\]space**, registered on 8 July 2025 via Namecheap and hosted on IP **45\\[.\\]141\\[.\\]58\\[.\\]199** by Seychelles-based IP Connect Inc., is assessed as likely malicious due to its recent registration and infrastructure commonly used in malware or phishing campaigns.\n\n### EXTERNAL THREAT LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT\n\nAPT36, also known as Transparent Tribe or Mythic Leopard, is a Pakistan-linked cyber-espionage group that has been active for over a decade, with campaigns becoming increasingly sophisticated since 2016\\. The group is widely assessed to operate with state sponsorship, focusing primarily on Indian government, military, and diplomatic institutions, while also expanding into education, defense contractors, and critical infrastructure sectors. Their operations typically rely on spear-phishing emails, malicious documents, spoofed login portals, and custom malware implants to gain and maintain access. APT36’s persistent targeting reflects its strategic objective of collecting sensitive information to support Pakistan’s military and diplomatic priorities.\n\nWhile Indian government entities remain the primary focus, APT36 has extended operations to adjacent sectors (education, research, and civil society), as well as opportunistic targeting in other geographies. This broad victimology increases the attack surface and introduces risk to partners, suppliers, and diplomatic missions abroad.\n\nThe adoption of .desktop payloads targeting Linux BOSS reflects a tactical shift toward exploiting indigenous technologies. Combined with traditional Windows-based malware and mobile implants, this shows the group’s intent to diversify access vectors and ensure persistence even in hardened environments.\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK Framework\n\n| **MITRE MAPPING**        |                                                                     |                                        |\n| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |\n| **Tactic**               | **ID**                                                              | **Technique Name**                     |\n| **Execution**            | T1064                                                               | Scripting                              |\n| T1053                    | Scheduled Task/Job                                                  |                                        |\n| **Defense Evasion**      | T1064                                                               | Scripting                              |\n| T1222                    | File and Directory Permissions Modification                         |                                        |\n| T1014                    | Rootkit                                                             |                                        |\n| T1564.001                | Hide Artifacts: Hidden Files and Directories                        |                                        |\n| **Persistence**          | T1053                                                               | Scheduled Task/Job                     |\n| T1037                    | Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts                                |                                        |\n| T1546.004                | Event Triggered Execution: Unix Shell Configuration Modification    |                                        |\n| T1543.002                | Create or Modify System Process: Systemd Service                    |                                        |\n| **Privilege Escalation** | T1053                                                               | Scheduled Task/Job                     |\n| T1546.004                | Event Triggered Execution: Unix Shell Configuration Modification    |                                        |\n| T1037                    | Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts                                |                                        |\n| T1543.002                | Create or Modify System Process: Systemd Service                    |                                        |\n| **Credential Access**    | T1003.001                                                           | OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory    |\n| **Discovery**            | T1082                                                               | System Information Discovery           |\n| T1083                    | File and Directory Discovery                                        |                                        |\n| **Collection**           | T1005                                                               | Data from Local System                 |\n| T1025                    | Data from Removable Media                                           |                                        |\n| **Command and Control**  | T1571                                                               | Non-Standard Port                      |\n| T1001.001                | Data Obfuscation: Junk Data                                         |                                        |\n| T1105                    | Ingress Tool Transfer                                               |                                        |\n| T1095                    | Non-Application Layer Protocol                                      |                                        |\n| T1071                    | Application Layer Protocol                                          |                                        |\n| T1090                    | Proxy                                                               |                                        |\n| **Exfiltration**         | T1048                                                               | Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol |\n| T1011.001                | Exfiltration Over Other Network Medium: Exfiltration Over Bluetooth |                                        |\n| **Impact**               | T1498                                                               | Network Denial of Service              |\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe analysis indicates a coordinated cyber-espionage campaign attributed to APT36, leveraging weaponized .desktop files to target BOSS Linux environments within Indian Government entities. These files are designed to masquerade as legitimate documents while covertly communicating with recently registered malicious domains such as “securestore\\[.\\]cv” and “modgovindia\\[.\\]space” to download and execute secondary payloads. Both domains exhibit characteristics typical of disposable threat infrastructure and have been flagged as malicious by multiple threat-intelligence sources. The group’s ability to rapidly deploy tailored payloads and infrastructure demonstrates increasing sophistication and underscores the need for heightened vigilance, particularly around spear-phishing vectors and Linux-based attack surfaces.\n\n## Recommendations and Mitigation\n\nRecommendations and Mitigation Strategies  \nTo mitigate the ongoing APT36 campaign targeting Indian Government entities through weaponized .desktop files and associated malicious domains, the following measures are formally recommended:\n\n**1\\. Email Security Enhancements**\n\n* Deploy advanced email security solutions capable of detecting spear-phishing emails that contain .desktop, .sh, .elf, and compressed archive attachments.\n* Disable automatic execution of email attachments and apply sandbox-based detonation of suspicious files prior to delivery.\n* Enable URL filtering to block connections to newly registered or malicious domains (e.g., securestore\\[.\\]cv, modgovindia\\[.\\]space).\n\n**2\\. User Awareness and Training**\n\n* Conduct regular cybersecurity awareness training, with emphasis on phishing indicators and high-risk Linux-specific file types.\n* Promote caution when handling unsolicited attachments, particularly .desktop files disguised as official documents, or unknown Google Drive links.\n\n**3\\. Host and Operating System Hardening**\n\n* Restrict execution of files from world-writable directories, such as /tmp, using filesystem mount options (noexec, nodev).\n* Disable execution of .desktop files from untrusted sources and enforce strict application authorization controls.\n* Apply least privilege principles in BOSS Linux deployments, with stringent controls over the use of utilities, such as curl, xxd, chmod, and nohup.\n\n**4\\. Endpoint and Network Monitoring**\n\n* Implement Linux-capable Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions to monitor for execution of unknown ELF payloads, lateral movement, and C2 beaconing activity.\n* Monitor DNS and outbound traffic for attempted connections to suspicious or recently registered APT36-associated domains.\n* Use network segmentation to contain any potential compromise and limit lateral movement within critical infrastructure.\n\n**5\\. Threat Intelligence Integration**\n\n* Integrate CYFIRMA-provided Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and YARA signatures into SIEM and IDS/IPS platforms to facilitate early detection.\n* Conduct initiative-taking threat hunting based on known APT36 tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mapped to MITRE ATT&CK (e.g., T1204, T1059, T1105).\n\n**6\\. Patch and Vulnerability Management**\n\n* Ensure BOSS Linux systems and commonly leveraged software (e.g., curl, LibreOffice) are patched promptly to mitigate exploitation of known vulnerabilities.\n\n**7\\. Behavior-Based Controls**\n\n* Deploy detection rules to identify suspicious command sequences (e.g., curl | xxd | chmod | nohup) executed through .desktop files or shell scripts.\n* Block execution of binaries downloaded via scripts unless verified and digitally signed by the organization.\n\nMaintaining ongoing situational awareness through CYFIRMA’s threat intelligence services, coupled with regular updates of IOCs and a defense-in-depth approach, will significantly enhance the ability to detect, prevent, and respond to APT36’s increasingly sophisticated intrusion activity.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nKindly refer to the IOCs section, applying relevant security controls.\n\n| **S.

It downloads a hex-encoded payload from  securestore.cv , decodes and executes it silently, while showing a benign PDF in Firefox as a decoy. Disguised with a PDF icon, set to run as an application, and enabled for autostart, it ensures persistence and stealth, letting malware operate unnoticed. The campaign was uncovered on August 1, 2025, and is still ongoing.\nTogether, these attributes support a classic social-engineering rule. Enabling X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true ensures that the file automatically runs every time the user logs in, granting the attacker persistence on the system.

It embeds the hardcoded C2 \"  modgovindia.space :4000\" and ensures persistence via cron jobs and systemd service abuse. On execution, it connects to the C2, using DNS queries and UDP sockets for stealthy communication, enabling data exfiltration and attacker control. The Operation Transparent Tribe (Operation C-Major, APT36, and Mythic Leopard) was first spotted by Proofpoint Researchers in Feb 2016, in a series of cyber espionage operations against Indian diplomats and military personnel in some embassies in Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan.

EXTERNAL THREAT LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT. APT36, also known as Transparent Tribe or Mythic Leopard, is a Pakistan-linked cyber-espionage group that has been active for over a decade, with campaigns becoming increasingly sophisticated since 2016.\n\nThese files are designed to masquerade as legitimate documents while covertly communicating with recently registered malicious domains such as \"securestore.cv\" and \"  modgovindia.space \" to download and execute secondary payloads. Both domains exhibit characteristics typical of disposable threat infrastructure and have been flagged as malicious by multiple threat-intelligence sources. The group's ability to rapidly deploy tailored payloads and infrastructure demonstrates increasing sophistication and underscores the need for heightened vigilance, particularly around spear-phishing vectors and Linux-based attack surfaces. Recommendations and Mitigation. Recommendations and Mitigation Strategies\n\nTo mitigate the ongoing APT36 campaign targeting Indian Government entities through weaponized .desktop files and associated malicious domains, the following measures are formally recommended: 1. Email Security Enhancements Deploy advanced email security solutions capable of detecting spear-phishing emails that contain .desktop, .sh, .elf, and compressed archive attachments. Disable automatic execution of email attachments and apply sandbox-based detonation of suspicious files prior to delivery. Enable URL filtering to block connections to newly registered or malicious domains (e.g., securestore.cv,  modgovindia.space ).\n\nIndicators of Compromise.

This flaw enables the injection of arbitrary ABAP code into the system, bypassing essential authorization checks.” [reads the advisory][2]. “This vulnerability effectively functions as a backdoor, creating the risk of full system compromise, undermining the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system.”_\n\nSAP S/4HANA ERP is SAP’s enterprise resource planning (ERP) suite, designed to help large and mid-sized organizations manage core business processes like finance, supply chain, manufacturing, sales, procurement, and human resources.\n\nThe flaw affects all SAP S/4HANA releases (Private Cloud and On-Premise) and can be exploited from a low-privileged account to fully compromise the system.\n\nThe vendor addressed the vulnerability on August 11, 2025.\n\nSecurityBridge Threat Research Labs found and confirmed an exploit for this issue that is active in the wild, recommending admins to immediately address the flaw.\n\n_“A complete system compromise with minimal effort required, where successful exploitation can easily lead to fraud, data theft, espionage, or the installation of ransomware.” [reported SecurityBridge][3]. “To demonstrate the potential impact of this vulnerability, we have created the attached Demo based on our own research and tooling:”_\n\nSecurityBridge experts warn that although not yet widespread, the flaw is already being abused. Unpatched SAP systems are exposed, and exploits are easy to craft by reverse-engineering the ABAP patch.\n\n_“The attacker needs only low-level credentials on the SAP system (any valid user account with permissions to call the vulnerable RFC module and the specific S\\_DMIS authorization with activity 02), and no user interaction is required.” concludes SecurityBridge._ \n\n_“The attack complexity is low and can be performed over the network, which is why the CVSS score is so high (9.9). In summary, a malicious insider or a threat actor who has gained basic user access (through phishing, for example) could leverage this flaw to **escalate into full control of the SAP environment**.

Code Insight keeps adding new file formats. This time, we’re looking at two vector-based formats from very different eras: SWF and SVG. Curiously, right after we rolled out this update in production, one of the very first submitted files gave us a perfect, and unexpected, example of Code Insight in action: it uncovered an undetected malware campaign using SVG files that impersonated the Colombian justice system.\n\n Audio version of this post, created with NotebookLM Deep Dive  \n\n Your browser does not support the audio element.\n\n  \n**SWF: a blast from the past**\n\nFlash is dead, Adobe killed it in 2020 and browsers stopped supporting it shortly after. But surprisingly, SWF files still show up on VirusTotal. Whether it’s old malware resurging, retro hunting, or long-tail campaigns, they haven’t disappeared completely.\n\nIn fact, VirusTotal received 47,812 unique SWF files in the last 30 days that had never been seen before, and 466 of them were flagged as malicious by at least one antivirus engine.\n\nSWF files are binary and compiled. That means Code Insight needs to:\n\n* Unpack and decompress the container (often zlib or LZMA)\n* Parse the internal tag structure\n* Extract embedded scripts, either ActionScript 2 (AVM1) or ActionScript 3 (AVM2 bytecode + decompiling/disassembling)\n\nOnce we lift those scripts into something closer to pseudocode or readable disassembly, the LLM steps in to summarize what the file is doing and why it might be suspicious.\n\n**SVG: modern, open, and still abusable**\n\nSVGs, on the other hand, are very much alive. It’s a standard web format, open, text-based, and everywhere: websites, design tools, build systems. And that’s also why attackers like it.\n\nIn the last 30 days alone, VirusTotal received 140,803 unique SVG files that had never been seen before, and 1,442 of them were flagged as malicious by at least one antivirus engine. That's roughly 1% showing up with detections, just like SWF curiously.\n\nSVG is just XML with <svg> at the root. If it’s a .svgz, we decompress it first. From there, Code Insight looks for:\n\n* Embedded JavaScript in <script> tags or event handlers (onload, onclick…)\n* Redirects using javascript: URLs or location.href\n* Obfuscation tricks (CDATA, character entities, base64 payloads, etc.)\n\nBecause SVG is plain text, the challenge isn’t unpacking, it’s spotting the malicious logic hiding in plain sight.\n\nLet’s see a couple of examples:\n\n**When a SWF is flagged, but isn’t malicious**\n\nOne common challenge in threat analysis is dealing with files that trigger detections in just a few antivirus engines. They’re not clean, but they’re not clearly malicious either. These gray areas force analysts to dig deeper, often wasting time chasing false positives.\n\nThe SWF file in the screenshot is a perfect example.\n\n[][1]\n\n[350422c3915a8a1a1336147f89061b25c8354af58db0050e2f9ef2b384e59f62][2] \n\n  \nIt was flagged by 3 out of 63 engines. Enough to raise doubts, but not conclusive. The detections mention known SWF heuristics and an old CVE.\n\nThanks to Code Insight, we can quickly understand what’s going on. It identifies the SWF as a complex ActionScript-based game, including 3D rendering, sound management, and a full level editor. The analysis also explains why the file might look suspicious: it uses obfuscated classes and cryptographic functions (like RC4 and AES), and gathers system details, techniques often associated with malware, but also common in Flash games to enforce DRM or prevent tampering.\n\nThe verdict? No malicious behavior was observed, and now we know why it looked suspicious in the first place.\n\nThis kind of context is exactly what Code Insight is designed for: saving time, reducing uncertainty, and helping you focus on real threats.\n\n  \n**When AV misses, but Code Insight doesn’t**\n\nThis second example shows the other side of the coin: a malicious SVG file that evaded all antivirus engines, going completely undetected on VirusTotal. On the surface, it looks clean, but a quick look with Code Insight tells a very different story.\n\n[][3]\n\n[1527ef7ac7f79bb1a61747652fd6015942a6c5b18b4d7ac0829dd39842ad735d][4] \n\n  \nAccording to Code Insight: _“This SVG file executes an embedded JavaScript payload upon rendering. The script decodes and injects a Base64-encoded HTML phishing page impersonating a Colombian government judicial system portal. To deceive the user, it simulates a file download with a progress bar, while in the background, it decodes a second, large Base64 string, which is a malicious ZIP archive, and forces its download.”_\n\nWe validated this behavior by opening the sample in a controlled environment. As shown in the screenshots below, the fake portal is rendered exactly as described, simulating an official government document download process. The phishing site includes case numbers, security tokens, and visual cues to build trust, all of it crafted within an SVG file.\n\n[][5]\n\n[][6]\n\n  \nDespite its zero detections, this SVG hides two layers of abuse:\n\n* A convincing phishing lure, injected via inline JavaScript and decoded on-the-fly\n* A malware dropper, silently extracting and triggering the download of a ZIP file in the background\n  \nThis is exactly the kind of threat Code Insight is meant to catch: well-crafted, script-based attacks that fly under the radar.\n\n**A deeper look: from one SVG to a full campaign**\n\nCuriously, the malicious SVG we highlighted earlier wasn’t just any random sample, it was one of the very first files submitted right after we deployed SVG support in Code Insight. A coincidence? Or were we seeing the tip of something bigger?\n\nThanks to VirusTotal Intelligence, we can search through our massive sample collection using hundreds of parameters, including queries that look inside Code Insight reports. So we ran:\n\n_type:svg AND codeinsight:\"Colombian\"_\n\n[][7]\n\n  \nAnd voilà: 44 unique SVG files surfaced, all undetected by antivirus engines, but all flagged by Code Insight as part of the same phishing and malware campaign.\n\nDiving into the source code of these SVGs, we found:\n\n* Code obfuscation techniques\n* Use of polymorphism, with slight changes in every file\n* And large amounts of dummy (garbage) code to increase entropy and evade static detection.\n\nBut Code Insight had no problem cutting through the noise.\n\nOne thing stood out: the attackers left Spanish-language comments in their scripts, with phrases like _\"POLIFORMISMO\\_MASIVO\\_SEGURO\"_ and _\"Funciones dummy MASIVAS\"_. While most of the code changed from sample to sample, those comments stayed exactly the same, a clear weakness, and a perfect signature for a simple YARA rule.\n\n[][8]\n\n  \nSo we wrote a very basic one:\n\n[][9]\n\n  \nRunning a retrohunt over the last year with this basic rule returned 523 matches.\n\n[][10]\n\n  \nSorting by submission time, the first sample dates back to August 14, 2025, also submitted from Colombia, and also with 0 antivirus detections at the time.\n\n[][11]\n\n  \nWe reanalyzed that first sample with the current version of Code Insight, and again, it produced an accurate description of the phishing page and malware dropper, impersonating the Colombian Fiscalía General de la Nación.\n\nLooking deeper, we saw that the earliest samples were larger, around 25MB, and the size decreased over time, suggesting the attackers were evolving their payloads. Most importantly, the distribution vector was email, allowing us to pivot into delivery metadata: senders, subjects, attachment names, and more.\n\n[][12]\n\n  \n**Final thoughts**\n\nSWF and SVG are very different formats from very different eras, but both can still cause headaches for analysts.\n\nIn the first case, Code Insight helped explain why a SWF file looked suspicious without actually being malicious. In the second, it uncovered malicious behavior in an SVG that had gone completely undetected.\n\nThis is where Code Insight helps most: giving context, saving time, and helping focus on what really matters. It’s not magic, and it won’t replace expert analysis, but it’s one more tool to cut through the noise and get to the point faster. And when Code Insight and VirusTotal Intelligence work together, one suspicious sample can become the key to revealing an entire campaign.\n\n\n[1]:

These include the use of an Easy Programming Language (EPL) to develop a staged payload, concealing malicious operations and disabling security tools to prevent alert triggers, securing Command and Control (C2) communications using mutual TLS (mTLS), supporting various methods for deploying additional payloads, and even installing popular remote access tools to grant attackers complete control over the compromised system. Figure 1 shows the attack chain.\n\nAlthough part of the attack flow and its C2 domains were mentioned in a 2020 public report as being associated with a banking trojan, the malware has since evolved into a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that we now call MostereRAT.\n\n## Initial Access\n\nThis attack campaign begins with phishing emails designed to lure Japanese users into clicking on malicious links. These emails are crafted to appear as if they come from legitimate sources, such as mimicking business inquiries, to deceive recipients into accessing an infected site, as illustrated in Figure 2.\n\nThe malicious file downloads automatically upon accessing the webpage, with an option to manually click a download button as well.\n\nA Word document with an embedded archive is downloaded to the victim's computer. Instead of continuing to use Japanese for social engineering, the attackers present a single instruction. This instruction guides the victim to open an embedded archive and run the only file it contains.\n\n## document.exe\n\nThis executable is based on the menu sample from the [wxWidgets ][1]GitHub repository and is used to deploy the necessary tools for the subsequent stage. The toolset is encrypted and bundled within the executable’s resources and includes images of a famous person, as shown in Figure 5.\n\nThe data is decrypted using a simple SUB operation with the key value of ‘A’. All components associated with the remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools and the next-stage payload are placed within C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Windows, as shown in Figure 6.\n\nIt advances to the next stage using [CreateSvcRpc][2], a custom RPC client that directly communicates with the ntsvcs named pipe to interact with the Windows Service Control Manager (SCM), bypassing standard APIs such as OpenSCManager, CreateService, StartService, and others. The resulting service runs with SYSTEM-level privileges.\n\n“WpnCoreSvc” is created with an automatic start type, ensuring it is loaded by the Service Control Manager during system startup to execute the next stage via a Ruby script. Another created service, “WinSvc\\_”, is configured for demand start and initiates the next stage by directly invoking a Launcher provided by the attacker, as shown in Figures 8 and 9.\n\nBefore terminating, the program displays a fake message in Simplified Chinese stating that the system version is incompatible and instructing the user to run the program on another computer, thereby continuing its spread via social engineering.\n\n## Malware Written in Easy Programming Language (EPL)\n\nEasy Programming Language (EPL) is a Simplified-Chinese-based programming language designed to be beginner-friendly and easy to understand, especially for native Chinese speakers.\n\nkrnln.fnr serves as the EPL runtime library, providing core functions such as string handling, file operations, window management, and more.\n\nOne of the compilation options in EPL is 'Compile to EPK', which compiles the code into an .epk file. This file requires an EPK launcher to invoke LoadEPKFromCmdLine in krnln.fnr for execution.\n\nThis stage involves an EPK launcher, a malicious EPK file named “svchost.exe,” and “svchost.db”. Execution starts by obtaining command-line arguments and evaluating the parameters to decide which next-stage modules to load, as seen in Figure 11.\n\nEach module is required to decrypt in a simple SUB operation with the key value of ‘A.’ The module is then loaded into memory and its exported function “getVersion” is called.\n\n## Module 1 - maindll.db\n\nParameters channel-8df91be7c24”**a**” to channel-8df91be7c24”**e**” are processed by module “maindll.db” and used to determine which task should be executed. Each task may execute a single function or consist of multiple functions. These functionalities include:\n\n#### Persistence through repeated execution of malicious code\n\nThe XML file defining the scheduled jobs is loaded from resources. It registers the jobs 'Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\winrshost' and 'Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\winresume', and creates a service named 'DnsNetwork' to launch a new instance with additional arguments. These instances are configured to run automatically—under the SYSTEM account (SID: S-1-5-18) during system startup, and under the built-in Administrators group (SID: S-1-5-32-544) upon user logon, as shown in Figure 12.\n\n#### Run as TrustedInstaller\n\nThe malware can create a new instance with full elevated privileges by leveraging the TrustedInstaller account, one of the most powerful in Windows.\n\nIt first enables SeDebugPrivilege and duplicates its own process token with elevated rights. Next, it locates and duplicates a SYSTEM process token, as shown in Figure 13, then starts the TrustedInstaller service and duplicates its token. Finally, it uses the TrustedInstaller token to launch a new process with full privileges. We noticed that the code is taken from the [NSudo ][3]project on GitHub.\n\n#### Interfere with AV/EDR solutions\n\nThe malware contains two built-in lists: one for security product paths and another for security product names.\n\n* Security product paths:\n\n_360:_\n\n“C:/Program Files/360/360Safe,”  \n“C:/Program Files/360/360sd,”  \n“C:/Program Files/360/360zip,”  \n“C:/Program Files (x86)/360/360Safe,”  \n“C:/Program Files (x86)/360/360sd,”  \n“C:/Program Files (x86)/360/360zip,”  \n“C:/ProgramData/360safe,”  \n“C:/ProgramData/360SD”\n\n_Kingsoft:_\n\n_“C:/Program Files/kingsoft/kingsoft antivirus,”_ \n _“C:/Program Files (x86)/kingsoft/kingsoft antivirus,”_ \n _\"C:/ProgramData/kdata,”_ \n _“C:/ProgramData/kdesk,”_ \n _“C:/ProgramData/Kingsoft,”_ \n _“C:/ProgramData/KRSHistory”_\n\n_Tencent PC Manager:_\n\n_“C:/Program Files/Tencent/QQPCMgr,”_ \n _\"C:/Program Files (x86)/Tencent/QQPCMgr,”_ \n _“C:/ProgramData/Tencent/QQPCMgr”_\n\n_Huorong Security:_\n\n_“C:/Program Files/Huorong/Sysdiag,”_ \n _“C:/Program Files (x86)/Huorong/Sysdiag,”_ \n _“C:/ProgramData/Huorong/Sysdiag”_\n\n_Windows Defender:_\n\n_“C:/Program Files/Windows Defender,”_ \n _“C:/Program Files (x86)/Windows Defender,”_ \n _“C:/ProgramData/Microsoft/Windows Defender”_\n\n_ESET:_\n\n_“C:/Program Files/ESET,”_ \n _“C:/ProgramData/ESET”_\n\n_Avira:_\n\n_“C:/Program Files/Avira,”_ \n _“C:/Program Files (x86)/Avira,”_ \n _“C:/ProgramData/Avira”_\n\n_Avast:_\n\n_“C:/Program Files/Avast Software,”_ \n _“C:/ProgramData/Avast Software”_\n\n_Malwarebytes:_\n\n_“C:/Program Files/Malwarebytes,”_ \n _“C:/ProgramData/Malwarebytes”_\n\n_AVG:_\n\n_“C:/Program Files/AVG,”_ \n _“C:/Program Files/Common Files/AVG,”_ \n _“C:/ProgramData/AVG”_\n\n_Others:_\n\n_“C:/Program Files (x86)/2345Soft/2345PCSafe,”_ \n _“C:/Program Files (x86)/Lenovo/PCManager,”_ \n _“C:/Program Files (x86)/Rising,”_ \n _“C:/Program Files/Microsoft PC Manager,”_ \n _“C:/Program Files/Common Files/AV”_\n\n* Security Product Names:\n\n_\"360Safe,\" \"360sd,\" \"antivirus,\" \"QQPCMgr,\" \"Sysdiag,\" \"Defender,\" \"Kaspersky,\" \"ESET Security,\" \"Security,\" \"Avira,\" \"Avast,\" \"Malwarebytes,\" \"Antivirus,\" \"Bitdefender,\" \"Norton,\" \"Symantec,\" \"McAfee,\" \"2345PCSafe,\" \"PCManager,\" \"Rising,\" and \"Microsoft PC Manager.\"_\n\nIt first checks whether a security solution is present by scanning for executable files within those paths. Then, it compares these executables against the image file paths of running processes. If a match is found and the image path contains a known security product name, the malware blocks its traffic.\n\nThis traffic-blocking technique resembles that of the known red team tool '[EDRSilencer][4]', which uses Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) filters at multiple stages of the network communication stack, effectively preventing it from connecting to its servers and from transmitting detection data, alerts, event logs, or other telemetry, as shown in Figure 14.\n\n**Disable Windows Security**\n\nThe malware employs multiple techniques to disable Windows updates and security mechanisms. It terminates processes such as 'SecurityHealthService.exe' and 'SecurityHealthSystray.exe,' stops services including 'wuauserv,' 'UsoSvc,' 'uhssvc,' and 'WaaSMedicSvc,' and deletes critical system files like 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\WaaSMedicSvc.dll' and 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\wuaueng.dll.'\n\nTo prevent these mechanisms from starting automatically, it removes scheduled tasks from specific task folders using ITaskFolder::DeleteTask and ITaskFolder::DeleteFolder.\n\n**Upgrade and launch a new program/module**\n\nTwo threads are created to communicate with the command and control (C2) server over HTTP using ports 9001 and 9002\\. The program also utilizes an RSA private key to decrypt the configuration file once it is available on the server, signaling that a new version is ready for download.\n\n**_http://{C2 Domain}:9001/9001.conf_** \n**_http://{C2 Domain}:9002/9002.conf_**\n\nNext, it parses the configuration file, formatted in INI style, and compares the version number to determine if downloading a new payload is necessary. The downloaded payload is verified using a SHA-256 hash before the new version is executed. Port 9001 is responsible for the EXE payload, whereas port 9002 handles the EPK payload.\n\n## Module 2 - elsedll.db\n\nParameters channel-8df91be7c24”**f**” is processed by module “elsedll.db.” This module features complex remote access capabilities, utilizing multiple threads to handle command and control operations, monitor foreground window activity associated with Qianniu - Alibaba's Seller Tool, log keystrokes, and send heartbeat signals.\n\nIt communicates with the Command and Control server using the same server list as Module 1, establishing a connection over TCP port 8000\\. The communication is secured through mutual TLS (mTLS), utilizing an embedded client key, client certificate, and CA certificate to enforce mutual authentication and prevent impersonation.\n\nThe C2 packet begins with a magic number 1234567890 (0x499602D2), followed by four bytes indicating the packet length and a command ID specifying the action to be performed. Supports up to 37 functions and can deploy popular remote access tools on the victim's system to enable complete control, as if using the system normally. The list below outlines commands with specific and evident functions.\n\n| **Command ID** | **Details**                                                                                                               |\n| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **0x7B98A2**   | Obtain the SHA-256 digest of a file.                                                                                      |\n| **0x7B98A3**   | Appear to be retrieving the version information.                                                                          |\n| **0x7B98A4**   | Used for sending heartbeat signals.                                                                                       |\n| **0x7B98A5**   | Collection of Victim Details.                                                                                             |\n| **0x7B9905**   | Send and run an EPK file using EPK launcher.                                                                              |\n| **0x7B9907**   | Send and run a DLL file using rundll32.                                                                                   |\n| **0x7B9908**   | Send and run an EXE file.                                                                                                 |\n| **0x7B990B**   | Send and load a shellcode into memory for execution.                                                                      |\n| **0x7B990C**   | Send and load an EXE into memory for execution.                                                                           |\n| **0x7B990D**   | Download and run an EPK file using the launcher.                                                                          |\n| **0x7B9910**   | Download and run a DLL file using rundll32.                                                                               |\n| **0x7B9911**   | Download and run an EXE file.                                                                                             |\n| **0x7B9937**   | Download and load shellcode into memory for execution.                                                                    |\n| **0x7B9938**   | Download and load an EXE into memory for execution.                                                                       |\n| **0x7B9969**   | Read the specific file located under the Database directory.                                                              |\n| **0x7B996A**   | Write data into the specific file located under the Database directory.                                                   |\n| **0x7B996B**   | Delete the specific file located under the Database directory.                                                            |\n| **0x7B996C**   | Write data into 09.db located under the Database directory.                                                               |\n| **0x7B997D**   | Load the EXE payload from C2 and run it using Early Bird Injection.                                                       |\n| **0x7B997E**   | Download and inject an EXE into svchost.exe using Early Bird Injection.                                                   |\n| **0x7B9EE1**   | Terminate remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools.

It also collects system information such as the computer name, Windows OS product details, system boot time, time since last user input, number of video capture drivers, and active user accounts. Additionally, it supports creating a screen capture.\n\n#### Download and execute plugins\n\nAs shown in Table 1, module 2 employs a wide range of methods to download and execute payloads in various ways. It can retrieve payloads from the current C2 connection or a specified URL using libcurl, supporting shellcode, EPK, DLL, and EXE formats.\n\nFor EXE payload, it can either be executed in-memory—such as through early bird injection—or written to disk and run as a standalone process. The DLL payload is typically saved to disk and executed via rundll32.exe, calling the getVersion export function. The EPK payload is launched by the EPK Launcher, while the ShellCode payload is written to allocated memory and then executed.\n\n#### File operation\n\nIn terms of file operations, the malware targets only files in the /database under the working directory and supports read, write, and delete operations.\n\nAlso, the file ID is used to identify files within the folder, ranging from 1001 (0x3E9) to 1009 (0x3F1) and corresponding to filenames 01.db through 09.db.\n\n#### Remote access tools deployment\n\nThe program is capable of running remote access and proxy tools using its configuration file embedded within resources. During the attack, AnyDesk, Xray, and TigerVNC are utilized and configured to grant exclusive access to the attacker.\n\nThe command also supports third-party RDP tool ‘RDP Wrapper’ and configuration changes, allowing quick modification of RDP settings—such as enabling or disabling multiple session logins via registry edits—and can restore the original RDP settings in the registry.\n\n#### Persistence via a hidden account\n\nThe command for creating a new user can add an account to the administrators group with a non-expiring password and hide it from the Windows login UI by modifying the registry path HKLM\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows NT\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Winlogon\\\\SpecialAccounts\\\\UserList, creating a REG\\_DWORD entry named after the username and setting its value to 0\\. However, in the code implementation, the entry name is hardcoded as 'V' instead of using the actual username.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis attack campaign uses social engineering as its initial vector and propagation methods to facilitate the spread of the threat. Additionally, MostereRAT employs more advanced and sophisticated techniques, such as incorporating an EPL program as one stage of the campaign, hiding the service creation method, blocking AV solution traffic, running as TrustedInstaller, using mTLS, and switching to legitimate remote access tools like AnyDesk, tightVNC, and RDP Wrapper to control the victim’s system.\n\nThese tactics significantly increase the difficulty of detection, prevention, and analysis. In addition to keeping your solution updated, educating users about the dangers of social engineering remains essential.\n\n### Fortinet Protections\n\nThe malware described in this report are detected and blocked by as:\n\nW32/Agent.MTR!tr  \nW32/Agent.295C!tr  \nW32/Agent.9C1D!tr\n\nFortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR support the FortiGuard Antivirus Service.

A key finding from that analysis was how our AI could apply contextual knowledge to its evaluation. It wasn’t just analyzing code in isolation, it was correlating a package's stated purpose (its name and description) with its actual behavior, flagging malicious logic that contradicted its public description. We’re now applying the same idea to one of the most common file formats in the world, the PDF.\n\n  \n Audio version of this post, created with NotebookLM Deep Dive  \n\n Your browser does not support the audio element.\n\n  \nPDFs are multi-layered. There’s the object tree (catalog, pages, objects, streams, actions, embedded files) and there’s the visible layer (text/images the user reads). Code Insights analyzes both, then correlates: does the document content, claims, and branding make sense given its internal behaviors? That lets us surface not only classic PDF exploitation (e.g., auto-actions, JS, external launches) but also pure social engineering (phishing, vishing, QR-lures) even when the file has no executable logic. This dual approach allows the AI not only to detect malicious code but also to identify sophisticated scams.\n\nLet's look at real-world samples surfaced by Code Insights during its initial testing phase. We'll start with cases where the PDF contains no malicious code, which traditional engines often miss because there's no executable payload to detect. This is where Code Insights proves useful, identifying clear signs of fraud and social engineering that aim to manipulate the user, not the machine.\n\n  \n**Case 1 - Fake debt collection targeting financial fraud**\n\nThis PDF is a real-world sample sent to VirusTotal and captured by Code Insights during early testing. It was flagged as malicious based entirely on its visible content, without relying on any embedded code or execution logic. The file was marked as clean by all other engines, likely because it contains no scripts, exploits, or embedded payloads.\n\n[][2]\n\n[d92a1a7460c580f8bf6af3cbd39c7840cfe6a146ee15ede8e23c50c2a85becb9][3]\n\nThe document pretends to be a debt collection notice from a German agency acting on behalf of Amazon. It includes a formal layout, legal threats, payment instructions, and multiple references to German addresses and regulations. Visually, it looks legitimate.\n\n[][4]\n\n[][5]\n\n  \nHowever, the AI flagged it as fraudulent based on several critical inconsistencies, the most important one being the destination bank account. The payment is requested to an IBAN starting with BG, indicating a Bulgarian account. This contradicts the sender's claimed German identity and would be highly unusual for a legitimate German debt agency. This mismatch alone was enough for Code Insights to classify the file as fraudulent. Additional content cues (urgent tone, fee breakdown, legal pressure) support the assessment.\n\nAs described in the Code Insights analysis:\n\n_“The visual and textual content confirms the document is a sophisticated phishing attack. It masquerades as an urgent payment demand from a German debt collection agency, supposedly on behalf of Amazon. The document employs high-pressure tactics, including threats of legal action, additional fees, and credit score damage, to compel the recipient to act quickly. The primary and most conclusive indicator of fraud is the demand for payment to a Bulgarian bank account, which is a stark and highly irregular contradiction to the agency's purported German location and registration.”_\n\nThis is a case where AI adds value by reasoning over the content semantics, not the file structure. \n\n  \n**Case 2 - QR-based phishing (quishing) campaign**\n\nThis is another real-world PDF captured during early testing of Code Insights. At the time of analysis, no antivirus or malware detection engines flagged the file as malicious. The PDF has no embedded scripts, exploits, or execution logic. From a technical perspective, it looks benign.\n\n[][6]\n\n[259e202847d04866acd76427f53bfd9a15372ed6ed56a9e54ba1c62442c945ee][7]\n\nThe visible content, however, impersonates an HR notification about a salary increase. It includes multiple social engineering red flags: awkward grammar, lack of personalization, and an irrelevant privacy disclaimer. The only call to action is a QR code, encouraging the recipient to scan it for more details.\n\n[][8]\n\n  \nCode Insights analyzed and decoded the QR, extracting the hidden URL. The domain is non-corporate and clearly unrelated to HR or payroll systems. The combination of deceptive HR messaging with a QR code that conceals a phishing URL confirms the document is a credential harvesting fraud delivered via PDF.\n\n  \n**Case 3 - Vishing via fake PayPal alert**\n\nThis is another real-world PDF flagged by Code Insights during early evaluation. No antivirus or malware detection engines classified the file as malicious. Structurally, it’s simple and inert: there are no scripts, automatic actions, or embedded links. Minor stream decoding errors are present but considered low-risk anomalies.\n\n[][9]\n\n[d0bedc70085efff5218b901cdaba95d565df867495181544041ba4b8a6019cea][10]\n\n[][11]\n\n  \nThe threat lies entirely in the content. The document impersonates PayPal and trusted brands like Visa to deliver a fake security alert about a high-value unauthorized purchase. The language is urgent and designed to induce panic.\n\nAccording to Code Insights:\n\n_“\\[...\\]the visual content of the document is a clear social engineering lure designed for a voice phishing (vishing) attack. \\[...\\] The document's sole purpose is to persuade the user to call a specific phone number under the pretense of canceling the fraudulent order. The malicious nature is confirmed by several red flags, including an awkwardly phrased greeting and a phone number with a geographic area code (808) that is deceptively labeled as \"Toll-Free.\" This tactic aims to route the victim to a scammer for social engineering and potential fraud.”_\n\n  \n**Case 4 - Fake Tax Refund from the Australian Taxation Office**\n\nAs with previous cases, this PDF wasn’t flagged by any antivirus engine in VirusTotal, but Code Insights identified it as a phishing lure that impersonates the Australian Taxation Office.\n\n[][12]\n\n[b9b763e4b091bc59e9b9f355617622dbabdc1ff2de6707a94ccb26aa7682300e][13] \n\n[][14]\n\n  \nAs described by Code Insights:\n\n_“This document is a phishing lure designed to impersonate the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). The visual layer uses an authentic-looking government logo and the promise of a tax refund to entice the recipient into clicking an \"Access Document\" button. The purpose is to have the user provide an electronic signature for a supposed refund authorization, creating a sense of urgency and financial incentive. The document exhibits multiple red flags common to phishing attacks. These include a generic greeting, a suspicious reference to a .doc file (a common malware vector), instructions that discourage direct replies, and a complete lack of legitimate contact information or alternative methods for verification. The entire premise relies on tricking the user into clicking the button, which likely leads to a malicious website for credential theft or malware download.”_\n\n  \n**Auto-executing PDF Posing as a Movie Download**\n\nUnlike previous examples, this PDF was flagged by 13 antivirus engines in VirusTotal. In this case, the attack is embedded both in the internal structure of the file and its visual appearance. Code Insights correlates these two layers, the technical and the social, to expose the malicious intent.\n\n[][15]\n\n[44e653fe79d1ab160c784c06f4d99def6419e379ef3f802af9f48d595976d2c7][16]\n\n[][17]\n\n  \nAs described by Code Insights:\n\n_“The document presents a social engineering lure, masquerading as a download page for pirated movies \\[…\\] to entice users into clicking links. This theme, centered on illegal content distribution, is a common tactic for malware delivery. Technical analysis of the PDF's internal structure corroborates the malicious intent. The file is configured with an /OpenAction command, a high-risk feature designed to automatically execute an action upon the document being opened \\[…\\] The combination of a deceptive, high-risk theme with an automatic execution function indicates that the document’s purpose is to compromise the user's system.”_\n\nWe are actively improving Code Insight based on what we learn from these early cases. PDF is the 6th most common file type submitted to VirusTotal, with around 100,000 new samples uploaded every day. That volume requires us to be strategic: for now, only a selected percentage of PDF files submitted via the public web interface are processed by Code Insight, as we test, tune, and scale the system.\n\nThese first results are helping us refine both effectiveness and performance. We’ll continue expanding coverage as we improve detection of threats.\n\n\n[1]: https://blog.virustotal.com/2025/08/code-insight-expands-to-uncover-risks.html\n[2]:

The attackers accessed Salesforce CRM systems via compromised OAuth tokens, stealing contact details, account records, support case data, and even authentication tokens and cloud secrets, potentially affecting over 700 organizations. The campaign has been attributed to the threat actor UNC6395.\n* Jaguar Land Rover has [confirmed][3] a cyber attack that resulted in severe disruption to its global IT systems. The attack forced production and retail operations to halt and factory staff to stay at home. The incident involved a data breach, the extent of which has not yet been disclosed. A group of English-speaking cybercriminals have claimed responsibility for the attack via Telegram.\n* Manufacturer Bridgestone Americas has [suffered][4] a cyber attack that resulted in operational disruptions. The disruption impacted several of its North American facilities, with production facilities in South Carolina and Quebec. While no evidence of customer data theft or interfaces compromise were reported, the incident could lead to supply shortages.\n* Fintech platform Wealthsimple has [disclosed][5] a data breach that resulted in unauthorized access to personal information belonging to less than 1% of its clients. Personal data includes contact details, government IDs, account numbers, IP addresses, Social Insurance Numbers, and dates of birth. No customer funds were stolen, and account passwords were not compromised in the incident.\n* The Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Office [confirmed][6] that a ransomware attack caused its ongoing two-week service outage, which disrupted its website, email, and phone systems. Officials refused to pay the ransom and are working through alternative channels.\n* The City of Baltimore was [scammed][7] out of more than $1.5 million. The threat actor spoofed a city vendor, gained access to its Workday account, and tricked Accounts Payable employees into approving fraudulent bank changes. A lack of proper verification procedures allowed two large payments to be sent, of which only the smaller was recovered.\n* Brazilian fintech giant Sinqia S.A. has [experienced][8] a cyber attack that resulted in hackers breaching its systems and attempting to steal $130 million. The actors tried to make unauthorized transactions on Brazil’s Pix real-time payment system. The incident led to Sinqia’s access to Pix being revoked.\n* Gaming website Chess.com has [suffered][9] a data breach that resulted in the exposure of personal information for 4,541 users through a compromised third-party file transfer tool. The breach occurred between June 5 and June 18, and reportedly no banking information or member account credentials, including usernames and passwords, were leaked.\n\n**VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHES**\n\n* A patch has been [released][10] for zero-day vulnerabilities CVE-2025-55177 in WhatsApp and CVE-2025-43300 in Apple’s iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. These vulnerabilities were actively exploited in targeted attacks against specific individuals. CVE-2025-55177 involved incomplete authorization in device synchronization, allowing processing of arbitrary URLs. It could be chained with CVE-2025-43300, an out-of-bounds write flaw, for sophisticated exploitation. No technical details or proof-of-concept have been published, but exploitation was observed in the wild.\n* Details on a critical ViewState deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2025-53690) in Sitecore were The vulnerability enabled remote code execution on affected internet-facing instances and observed actively exploited in the wild. Attackers leveraged the flaw for initial compromise, privilege escalation, credential dumping, Active Directory reconnaissance, and lateral movement using open-source tools and malware. Exploitation led to the creation of local administrator accounts, deployment of persistence mechanisms, and exfiltration of sensitive configuration files.\n\n_Check point IPS blade provides protection against this threat_ _(Sitecore Multiple Products Insecure Deserialization (CVE-2025-53690)_\n\n* NVIDIA [released][11] September 2025 security updates addressing multiple high and medium severity vulnerabilities across BlueField, ConnectX, DOCA, Mellanox DPDK, Cumulus Linux, and NVOS. Exploits could allow attackers to escalate privileges, tamper with configurations, cause denial of service, or expose sensitive information.\n\n**THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORTS**\n\n* Check Point [reports][12] on Hexstrike-AI, a newly released AI-powered framework that orchestrates more than 150 specialized agents to scan, exploit, and persist inside targets, reducing exploitation time from days to minutes. Though designed for red-team testing, threat actors quickly tried to repurpose it to weaponize different vulnerabilities. The tool shows how AI orchestration can rapidly accelerate large-scale, real-world exploitation.\n* Amazon [disrupted][13] a watering hole campaign by Russia-linked APT29 (Midnight Blizzard), which used compromised websites to redirect victims into attacker-controlled Microsoft device code authentication flows. The campaign demonstrated APT29’s evolving tactics, including obfuscated JavaScript injections, server-side redirects, and rapid infrastructure adaptation.\n* Researchers [identified][14] a novel China-aligned threat actor, GhostRedirector, leveraging a C++ backdoor – “Rungan”, and an IIS module -“Gamshen”, to compromise at least 65 Windows servers, primarily in Brazil, Thailand, and Vietnam. Gamshen manipulates IIS responses to Googlebot for SEO fraud, while Rungan provides remote command execution and persistence. The attackers gain initial access via likely SQL Injection and create rogue admin users to ensure long-term access across different sectors including healthcare, retail, transportation, and education..\n\n\n[1]: https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Threat%5FIntelligence%5FNews%5F2025-09-08.pdf\n[2]:

threats against public sector organizations are rising in both scale and complexity. One of the most popular attacks that government finance and procurement teams are targeted with is business email compromise (BEC). Recently, these attacks have become even more difficult to spot with now using AI-generated content, which further blurs the line between an authentic and a fraudulent request. \n\nWhat makes so dangerous is that they typically don't involve malicious links or malware payloads. Instead, cybercriminals rely on lies, impersonation, and to bypass traditional security defenses. Attacks that don’t have payloads are a blind spot for many security vendors. They result in what's known as a \"design false negative,\" which means that they go undetected because systems simply weren’t built to see them. \n\nRecently, our threat research team identified and blocked a sophisticated BEC campaign that sailed right through a competitor's security gate. This attack highlights the critical need for a modern, multilayered defense strategy that looks beyond the obvious. \n\n### **The threat: How did the attack happen?** \n\nThe attack began with an email that appeared to be a legitimate request for a proposal (RFP) from a procurement director at a major U.S. federal agency. Sent to directors of procurement at various companies, the email requested a quote for a large computer equipment supply contract. Attached was a seemingly harmless PDF document with bid details. \n\n_Email used by threat actor._ \n\nAt first glance, the message seemed legitimate. However, a closer look revealed the attacker's subtle but effective tactics: \n\n* **Impersonation.** The email impersonated a real government agency to build credibility.\n* **Payload-less lure.** The attached PDF contained no malware, so it wouldn't trigger traditional antivirus or sandboxing analysis. The body of the email was clean and contained no suspicious URLs.\n* **Conversation starter.** The attacker's goal wasn't a quick click. Instead, it was to initiate a conversation, establish rapport with the target, and then pivot to financial fraud, such as requesting payment to a fraudulent account.\n* **Domain spoofing.** The attackers registered a lookalike domain, federalagency\\[.\\]org, to mimic the real agency's legitimate .gov domain. The new domain was created just last month—a major red flag.\n* **Header manipulation.** The From field showed a plausible name, but the Reply-To header directed responses to the attacker-controlled federalagency\\[.\\]org domain, a classic BEC technique.\n\nFor the incumbent security solution, which relies heavily on spotting known bad links or malicious files, this attack was designed to be invisible. Their system, which primarily uses static dictionaries for display name , saw nothing technically wrong with the message and delivered it. \n\n### **The detection: How Proofpoint stopped the attack** \n\nThis threat was immediately identified and blocked for all our customers. We stopped this attack not because of one single feature, but because our AI platform employs a multilayered detection approach that combines , advanced analytics, and world-class . \n\n_Proofpoint Nexus AI detection engines identified the threat as a lure._ \n\nHere’s how our threat research team and Nexus detection stack worked together to stop this threat: \n\n#### Unmatched threat intelligence \n\nWe weren't seeing this attack for the first time. Our threat research team has been tracking this specific threat actor and their [TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures)][1] since 2022\\. We know they target supply chain professionals who work with government entities. This intelligence is continuously fed into our detection engines, allowing us to recognize and proactively block their campaigns. \n\n#### Advanced BEC detection \n\nOur Nexus detection stack is purpose-built to stop impersonation attacks. It analyzed multiple signals in real time and immediately identified the threat. Our Nexus Relationship Graph (RG) recognized that the email came from an uncommon sender—someone who does not frequently correspond with anyone at this government agency. Our Nexus Machine Learning (ML) engine identified that the domain was a suspicious lookalike that had been recently registered—and that there was a mismatch between the From and Reply-To fields. Together, these factors resulted in the message receiving a BEC score of 100, leading to an immediate block. \n\n#### Deep content analysis \n\nOur intelligence extends to the content itself. Through our research, we know that the real federal agency embeds a specific digital tag in their official PDFs. Our Nexus Threat Intelligence (TI) engine recognized that the attacker's PDF was missing this tag and flagged the situation as strongly suspicious. Furthermore, the subject line, message body, and RFP language were all consistent with previous campaigns from this tracked actor. \n\nThis combination of deep historical intelligence and advanced Nexus detection capabilities allowed us to see what others couldn't: a dangerous impersonation attack hiding in plain sight. \n\n### **The stakes are higher than one email** \n\nBEC attacks accounted for [73% of all reported cyber incidents in 2024][2], underscoring their disproportionate impact on government and regulated sectors, including numerous federal entities. When a BEC threat like this succeeds, the consequences can be severe and multifaceted. \n\n* **Financial loss.** The primary target—the supplier—could be tricked into sending funds to a fraudulent account, resulting in significant financial loss.\n* **Brand abuse.** The reputation of the impersonated government agency is damaged, making legitimate partners and suppliers wary of future communications.\n* **Erosion of public trust.** These attacks undermine citizen and business confidence in the security of government operations and services.\n\nThreat actors are constantly evolving, and security providers must evolve with them. Payload-less threats that rely on social engineering are becoming more common because they work. Defending against them requires a solution that can analyze context, behavior, and reputation—not just files and links. Our success in blocking this campaign is a testament to our continued investment in the intelligence and technology needed to stop the threats of today and tomorrow. \n\nLearn more about . \n\n###

ShinyHunters administrators have operated multiple iterations of BreachForums, the internet's largest stolen data marketplace, facilitating thousands of cybercriminal transactions and serving as a critical hub for threat actor collaboration.\n\nRecent law enforcement actions in France resulted in the arrest of four key members in June 2025, yet operations continue under a decentralized model that demonstrates remarkable organizational resilience.\n\nMost concerning is the group's recent tactical evolution toward sophisticated social engineering campaigns targeting cloud infrastructure, particularly Salesforce environments through voice phishing (vishing) attacks.\n\nThese operations, conducted in collaboration with other elite threat actors like Scattered Spider, represent a paradigm shift from opportunistic data theft to targeted enterprise infiltration with significantly higher impact potential.\n\nThreat Actor Profile.\n\nOrigins and Formation.\n\nShinyHunters first appeared on cybercrime forums in early May 2020, immediately distinguishing themselves through the scale and audacity of their initial operations.\n\nWithin two weeks of their debut, the group offered over 200 million user records for sale on dark web marketplaces, announcing their presence with breaches of major platforms including Tokopedia (91 million records) and Unacademy (22 million records). This explosive introduction established their reputation as a serious threat actor capable of compromising well-protected systems at unprecedented scale.\n\nThe group's moniker reflects both their methodology and cultural identity within gaming communities. Pokemon shiny hunting involves systematic, patient searching for rare variants - a parallel to their approach of methodically targeting high-value datasets from prominent organizations.\n\nThis cultural reference also served as operational security, allowing members to communicate using gaming terminology that provided natural cover for criminal activities.\n\nOrganizational Structural Evolution.\n\nInitial intelligence suggested ShinyHunters operated as a small, tight-knit collective with specialized roles including reconnaissance, initial access, data exfiltration, and marketplace operations.\n\nHowever, recent analysis indicates a more complex, decentralized structure resembling an extortion-as-a-service model where the ShinyHunters brand provides legitimacy and market access for multiple affiliated groups.\n\nFrench law enforcement arrests in June 2025 targeted four core members identified by aliases ShinyHunters, Hollow, Noct, and Depressed, along with IntelBroker who was arrested separately in February 2025.\n\nDespite these significant arrests, operations have continued under new leadership, suggesting either deeper organizational redundancy or successful transition to a franchise-based model where the brand operates independently of original founders.\n\nBusiness Model.\n\nShinyHunters operates as a purely financially motivated threat actor with multiple revenue streams designed to maximize profit from stolen data. Their business model has evolved significantly since 2020, transitioning from simple data sales to sophisticated extortion operations that leverage both private negotiations and public pressure campaigns.\n\nPrimary Revenue Streams:\n\n\nDirect Data Sales: Initial operations focused on selling stolen databases on underground forums for prices ranging from $500 to $40,000 depending on data sensitivity and volume.\n\nExtortion Operations: Evolution toward direct victim extortion with ransom demands ranging from $200,000 (AT&T) to $8 million (Ticketmaster).\n\nForum Administration: Revenue from BreachForums operations including vendor fees, premium memberships, and transaction commissions.\n\nCollaboration Services: Acting as data brokers for other threat actors and providing initial access as a service.\n\n\nThe group demonstrates sophisticated understanding of data monetization, often releasing samples publicly to establish authenticity while maintaining larger datasets for private sales or extortion. Their strategy of delayed extortion - sometimes waiting months between breach and ransom demands - maximizes leverage by allowing organizations to develop false confidence in their security posture.\n\nChronological Timeline of Activity.\n\nStage 1: The Great Data Harvest (May 2020 - July 2021).\n\nShinyHunters' initial campaign, dubbed Stage 1 by the group themselves, focused on mass data acquisition through opportunistic exploitation of vulnerable systems. This period established their reputation through high-profile breaches targeting popular consumer platforms and services.\n\nMay 2020 - Initial Emergence:\n\n\nTokopedia Breach: 91 million user records from Indonesia's largest e-commerce platform, including names, emails, phone numbers, and hashed passwords..\n\nMicrosoft GitHub Incident: Claimed theft of 500GB of source code from private Microsoft repositories, with 1GB released as proof.\n\nUnacademy Compromise: 22 million records from Indian online education platform.\n\n\nMid-2020 Expansion:\n\n\nHomeChef: 8 million meal kit delivery service customers.\n\nZoosk: 30 million dating app users.\n\nChatbooks: 15 million photo printing service customers.\n\nMindful: 2 million wellness platform users.\n\nMinted: 5 million design marketplace users.\n\n\nJuly 2020 - Stage 2 Escalation:\n\n\nWattpad: 270 million social storytelling platform users in their largest single breach to date.\n\nBigBasket: 20 million Indian online grocery customers.\n\nAnimalJam: 46 million records from children's gaming platform.\n\n\nStage 2: Consolidation and Forum Operations (2021-2023).\n\nThis period marked ShinyHunters' transition from purely operational activities to ecosystem management through forum administration and strategic partnerships. The group began focusing on higher-value targets while simultaneously building infrastructure for long-term cybercrime facilitation.\n\n2021 Operations:\n\n\nAT&T Wireless: 70 million subscriber records including personal information and Social Security numbers.\n\nPixlr: 1.9 million photo editing service users.\n\nDave Inc: 7.5 million digital banking customers.\n\n\n \nBreachForums Administration (2023-2025): \n\nShinyHunters assumed control of BreachForums following the arrest of original administrator pompompurin in March 2023. Under their leadership, the forum became the primary global marketplace for stolen data, facilitating thousands of transactions and serving as a coordination hub for international cybercrime operations. \n\nStage 3: Advanced Persistent Extortion (2024-2025).\n\nThe current phase represents ShinyHunters' evolution into sophisticated, targeted operations combining traditional data theft with advanced social engineering and strategic extortion campaigns. This period is characterized by collaboration with other elite threat actors and focus on high-value cloud infrastructure.\n\n2024 Major Operations:\n\n\nTicketmaster: 560 million Live Nation customer records with ransom demands escalating from $1 million to $8 million.\n\nAdvanced Persistent Presence: Establishing long-term access to multiple systems for sustained data collection.\n\n\n \n2025 Salesforce Campaign: \n\nThe group's most sophisticated operation to date involves systematic targeting of Salesforce environments across multiple industries through coordinated vishing attacks. Confirmed victims include Google, Adidas, LVMH brands, Allianz Life, Air France-KLM, Pandora, Qantas, Chanel, and Farmers Insurance. \n\nTechnical Analysis.\n\n\n\nShinyHunters MITRE ATT&CK Framework TTP Mapping\n\nTactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).\n\nShinyHunters demonstrates advanced technical capabilities across the full spectrum of cyber operations, with particular expertise in social engineering, cloud infrastructure exploitation, and data exfiltration at scale. Their methodology combines opportunistic vulnerability exploitation with targeted, intelligence-driven operations against high-value systems.\n\nInitial Access Methodologies:\n\n \nSocial Engineering Excellence: The group's most distinctive capability lies in sophisticated social engineering operations that exploit human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities. \n\nTheir vishing campaigns involve extensive reconnaissance to identify appropriate targets, development of convincing pretexts, and manipulation of organizational trust relationships to achieve access objectives. \n\n \nRecent Salesforce campaigns demonstrate unprecedented sophistication in social engineering execution. \n\nAttackers conduct detailed research on target organizations to identify appropriate personnel, develop convincing technical support scenarios, and guide victims through complex authentication processes while maintaining the illusion of legitimate IT assistance. \n\nThese operations often involve multiple contact attempts, escalation scenarios, and psychological pressure tactics designed to overcome natural security awareness. \n\n \nCredential Harvesting and Stuffing: ShinyHunters employs multiple approaches to credential acquisition including targeted phishing campaigns, exploitation of previously breached databases, and automated credential stuffing attacks against high-value targets. \n\nThe group maintains extensive databases of compromised credentials from their own operations and third-party sources, enabling persistent access attempts across multiple platforms. \n\nGitHub Repository Analysis: A significant component of their reconnaissance involves systematic analysis of target organization GitHub repositories to identify potential vulnerabilities, exposed credentials, and architectural information.\n\nThis approach allows identification of security weaknesses in application code, misconfigured authentication systems, and exposed API keys that can facilitate initial access.\n\nExecution and Persistence Techniques:\n\nOAuth Application Abuse: ShinyHunters has pioneered sophisticated abuse of OAuth authorization frameworks, particularly within Salesforce environments. Their methodology involves the creation of malicious connected applications disguised as legitimate business tools, social engineering of users to authorize these applications, and exploitation of granted permissions to maintain persistent access without triggering traditional authentication monitoring.\n\nThe technical execution involves registering OAuth applications with names like My Ticket Portal or Salesforce Data Management Tool that appear legitimate to end users. These applications request extensive permissions including data access, query capabilities, and administrative functions. Once authorized, the applications generate long-lived access tokens that enable ongoing data extraction without further user interaction or multi-factor authentication requirements.\n\nCustom Tool Development: Technical analysis reveals sophisticated custom tooling designed specifically for large-scale data extraction and processing. These tools include modified versions of legitimate applications like Salesforce Data Loader, custom Python scripts for automated data harvesting, and specialized utilities for processing and formatting stolen datasets for marketplace sales.\n\nInfrastructure and Operational Security:\n\nTraffic Obfuscation and Anonymization: All operational activities employ multiple layers of traffic obfuscation including Tor networks, commercial VPN services (particularly Mullvad VPN), and proxy chains to complicate attribution and evade detection. This infrastructure enables sustained access to compromised systems while maintaining operational security against law enforcement and security researcher tracking.\n\nDistributed Command and Control: Rather than traditional centralized C2 infrastructure, ShinyHunters operates through distributed communication channels including encrypted messaging platforms, underground forums, and ephemeral communication systems that provide resilience against law enforcement disruption.\n\nData Exfiltration and Processing Capabilities.\n\nShinyHunters demonstrates exceptional capabilities in large-scale data processing, with operations involving hundreds of millions of records requiring sophisticated technical infrastructure and methodology. Their approach combines automated collection systems with manual analysis to identify high-value datasets within broader data repositories.\n\nTechnical evidence suggests deployment of custom automated collection tools capable of systematically extracting data from various database systems, cloud storage platforms, and application programming interfaces. These systems employ parallel processing techniques to maximize collection speed while minimizing detection probability through distributed query patterns.\n\nStolen datasets undergo systematic processing to identify personally identifiable information, financial data, authentication credentials, and other high-value information categories. This processing enables strategic pricing and marketing of datasets based on data sensitivity and potential criminal utility.\n\nThe group employs sophisticated quality assurance processes to verify dataset authenticity and completeness before marketplace listing or extortion operations. This includes automated validation of data formats, manual spot-checking of records, and cross-referencing with known data sources to ensure accuracy and prevent fraudulent listings that could damage their reputation.\n\nData Breaches and Cyberattacks.\n\n\n\n\nOrganization\nDate\nRecords\nSector\nGeography\n\n\n\n\nTokopedia\n2020-05-02\n91 million\nE-commerce\nIndonesia\n\n\nMicrosoft GitHub\n2020-05-15\n500GB source code\nTechnology\nGlobal\n\n\nUnacademy\n2020-05-20\n22 million\nEducation\nIndia\n\n\nWattpad\n2020-07-15\n270 million\nSocial Media\nCanada\n\n\nBigBasket\n2020-10-01\n20 million\nE-commerce\nIndia\n\n\nPixlr\n2021-01-15\n1.9 million\nTechnology\nGlobal\n\n\nDave Inc\n2021-07-01\n7.5 million\nFinancial Services\nUnited States\n\n\nAT&T\n2021-08-01\n70 million\nTelecommunications\nUnited States\n\n\nTicketmaster\n2024-05-29\n560 million\nEntertainment\nGlobal\n\n\nAdidas\n2025-05-01\n5 million (est)\nRetail/Fashion\nGlobal\n\n\nPandora\n2025-06-01\n2 million (est)\nJewelry/Retail\nGlobal\n\n\nQantas\n2025-06-01\n5 million (est)\nAviation\nAustralia\n\n\nChanel\n2025-06-01\n3 million (est)\nLuxury Goods\nGlobal\n\n\nGoogle\n2025-06-01\n2.55 million\nTechnology\nGlobal\n\n\nLVMH (Louis Vuitton, Dior, Tiffany)\n2025-06-15\n10 million (est)\nLuxury Goods\nGlobal\n\n\nAir France-KLM\n2025-07-15\n3 million (est)\nAviation\nEurope\n\n\nAllianz Life\n2025-07-01\n1.4 million\nInsurance\nNorth America\n\n\nFarmers Insurance\n2025-08-01\n1.1 million\nInsurance\nUnited States\n\n\nWorkday\n2025-08-22\nBusiness contacts\nHR Technology\nGlobal\n\n\n\nComprehensive Victim Analysis.\n\nShinyHunters' five-year operational history encompasses breaches across virtually every major industry sector, with particular concentration in technology, financial services, retail, and telecommunications. Their victim selection demonstrates strategic targeting of organizations with large customer databases, valuable intellectual property, or strategic importance within critical infrastructure sectors.\n\nThe group's most significant operations have targeted major technology companies including Microsoft, Google, and numerous software-as-a-service providers. These breaches often involve source code theft, customer database exfiltration, and compromise of development infrastructure that can enable supply chain attacks against downstream customers.\n\nThe Microsoft GitHub breach in May 2020 represented a watershed moment demonstrating the group's capability to compromise even the most security-conscious organizations. While Microsoft initially disputed the significance of the compromise, subsequent analysis confirmed the authenticity of stolen source code, establishing ShinyHunters' credibility within cybercrime communities and attracting significant law enforcement attention.\n\nRecent operations demonstrate increasing focus on financial services organizations including digital banking platforms, insurance companies, and payment processors. These targets offer high-value personal financial information, transaction data, and authentication credentials that command premium prices on underground markets.\n\nThe compromise of Farmers Insurance affecting 1.1 million customers represents typical current operations combining technical sophistication with strategic targeting of organizations likely to pay substantial ransoms to prevent data publication. Similar patterns appear in attacks against Allianz Life and other insurance providers where regulatory compliance requirements create additional pressure for rapid incident resolution.\n\nRetail and Luxury Brands: The 2025 Salesforce campaign particularly targeted luxury retail brands including LVMH companies (Louis Vuitton, Dior, Tiffany & Co.), Adidas, Chanel, and Pandora. These organizations possess high-value customer databases containing wealthy individuals' personal information that serves both extortion and identity theft purposes.\n\nLuxury brand targeting also serves psychological warfare purposes, as these organizations typically have strong brand protection concerns and may pay substantial ransoms to prevent reputational damage associated with customer data breaches. The group's public disclosure of compromised luxury brands generates significant media attention that increases pressure on other potential victims.\n\nAttack Methodology Evolution.\n\nShinyHunters' operational methodology has undergone significant evolution from opportunistic vulnerability exploitation to highly targeted, intelligence-driven operations requiring substantial planning and resource investment. This evolution reflects both increased law enforcement pressure requiring improved operational security and recognition that targeted attacks against high-value organizations generate superior financial returns compared to mass exploitation of vulnerable systems.\n\nEarly Opportunistic Phase (2020-2021): Initial operations focused on identifying and exploiting publicly accessible vulnerabilities, misconfigured systems, and exposed databases. This approach enabled rapid accumulation of large datasets but generated relatively modest financial returns due to commodity pricing for common personal information categories.\n\nStrategic Targeting Phase (2022-2024): Operations evolved toward research-driven targeting of specific organizations based on data value assessment, financial capability analysis, and security posture evaluation. This phase involved substantial pre-operation intelligence gathering including reconnaissance of target personnel, system architecture analysis, and development of organization-specific attack methodologies.\n\n \nAdvanced Persistent Extortion Phase (2024-2025): Current operations represent highly sophisticated, multi-month campaigns involving persistent access maintenance, continuous data collection, and strategic extortion timing designed to maximize victim pressure and ransom payment probability. \n\nThese operations often involve collaboration with other elite threat actors and deployment of novel attack techniques specifically developed for high-value targets. \n\nCollaboration Networks and Partnerships.\n\nRecent intelligence indicates extensive collaboration between ShinyHunters and other prominent threat actors, particularly Scattered Spider and LAPSUS$, forming what researchers term Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters. These partnerships enable more sophisticated operations through shared resources, specialized expertise, and distributed operational capabilities that complicate law enforcement attribution and disruption efforts.\n\nScattered Spider Partnership: This collaboration combines ShinyHunters' data exfiltration expertise with Scattered Spider's advanced social engineering capabilities and initial access techniques.\n\nJoint operations typically involve Scattered Spider gaining initial network access through sophisticated vishing campaigns, followed by ShinyHunters conducting large-scale data extraction and subsequent extortion operations.\n\nLAPSUS$ Affiliation: Evidence suggests ongoing relationships with LAPSUS$ members providing additional technical capabilities, particularly in areas of cloud infrastructure exploitation and multi-factor authentication bypass.\n\nThis relationship has enabled operations against previously inaccessible high-security environments including government systems and critical infrastructure organizations.\n\nForum Ecosystem Management: Beyond operational partnerships, ShinyHunters' administration of BreachForums creates extensive networks with hundreds of other cybercriminals including initial access brokers, malware developers, and specialized service providers.\n\nThis ecosystem provides substantial intelligence, resource sharing, and collaboration opportunities that enhance their operational capabilities significantly beyond their core team's direct expertise.\n\nBusiness Model.\n\nShinyHunters operates as a sophisticated criminal enterprise with diversified revenue streams, strategic market positioning, and long-term business planning that distinguishes them from opportunistic cybercriminal groups.\n\nTheir approach combines traditional data theft with modern extortion techniques, marketplace operations, and service provision to other criminals in a comprehensive business model designed for sustained profitability and growth.\n\nFinancial Operations and Revenue Optimization.\n\nTiered Pricing Strategy: The group employs sophisticated pricing models based on data sensitivity, victim organization profile, and market demand dynamics.\n\nBasic personal information databases typically sell for $500-$3,500, while specialized datasets containing financial information, healthcare records, or corporate intelligence command significantly higher prices reaching $40,000 or more for premium datasets.\n\nRecent evolution toward direct extortion has dramatically increased revenue potential, with ransom demands ranging from $200,000 for smaller organizations to $8 million for major corporations like Ticketmaster.\n\nThis shift reflects recognition that organizations will pay substantially more to prevent data publication than criminals will pay to acquire published datasets.\n\nStrategic Market Timing: ShinyHunters demonstrates sophisticated understanding of market dynamics, often timing data releases and extortion demands to maximize psychological pressure on victims. This includes coordinating releases with major news cycles, regulatory compliance deadlines, or competitive business activities that increase organizational sensitivity to reputation damage.\n\nThe group's practice of delayed extortion - maintaining access for months before making demands - serves multiple strategic purposes including comprehensive data collection, victim organization assessment, and timing optimization for maximum leverage. This patience distinguishes them from opportunistic criminals focused on immediate monetization.\n\nEcosystem Development, Infrastructure Investment.\n\nBreachForums Administration: Operation of the internet's largest stolen data marketplace represents a significant long-term investment in cybercrime ecosystem development. Forum administration provides multiple revenue streams including vendor fees, premium memberships, transaction commissions, and strategic intelligence about emerging threats and opportunities.\n\nForum control also enables market manipulation through selective promotion of certain data types, strategic timing of major releases, and coordination with other criminal organizations to maximize overall ecosystem profitability. This level of market influence provides substantial competitive advantages in their core data theft operations.\n\nService Provider Evolution: Recent evidence indicates evolution toward providing specialized services to other criminal organizations including initial access brokerage, data processing and validation, and extortion negotiation services.\n\nThis diversification reduces dependence on direct operations while leveraging their expertise and reputation to generate consistent revenue from the broader criminal ecosystem.\n\nRisk Management and Operational Resilience.\n\nDecentralized Operations: Following law enforcement arrests in France, ShinyHunters has adapted through operational decentralization that maintains brand recognition while reducing individual member exposure.\n\nThis model enables continued operations despite personnel losses and provides resilience against future law enforcement actions.\n\nBrand Value Protection: The group invests substantially in reputation management within criminal communities, including consistent delivery on promises, quality assurance for data sales, and reliable service provision to other criminals. This reputation represents significant business value that enables premium pricing and preferential partnerships within the criminal ecosystem.\n\nStrategic Intelligence: ShinyHunters maintains extensive intelligence capabilities focused on law enforcement activities, security researcher tracking, and competitive threat assessment.\n\nThis intelligence enables proactive operational security adjustments, strategic timing of major operations, and early warning systems for potential disruption attempts.\n\nStrategic Implications for Organizations.\n\nThe evolution of ShinyHunters from opportunistic data thieves to sophisticated enterprise-targeting threat actors represents a fundamental shift in the cybercrime landscape with far-reaching implications for organizational security strategies, regulatory compliance frameworks, and industry-wide risk management approaches.\n\nTheir success has inspired numerous imitators and established operational methodologies that are being adopted by threat actors globally, creating a multiplier effect that extends their impact far beyond their direct operations.\n\nIndustry-Specific Risk Assessment.\n\nTechnology Sector Vulnerabilities: ShinyHunters' focus on technology companies reflects both the high value of intellectual property and customer data held by these organizations and their often-complex security environments that create exploitation opportunities.\n\nSoftware-as-a-service providers face particular risk due to their role as data processors for multiple client organizations, creating single points of failure that can impact thousands of downstream customers simultaneously.\n\nThe group's systematic exploitation of cloud infrastructure, particularly Salesforce environments, demonstrates sophisticated understanding of modern enterprise architecture and the trust relationships that enable business operations.\n\nOrganizations heavily dependent on cloud services must reassess their security models to account for social engineering attacks that bypass technical controls through human manipulation.\n\nFinancial Services Exposure: The increasing focus on financial services organizations reflects both the direct value of financial data and the regulatory pressure these organizations face that makes them more likely to pay substantial ransoms. Insurance companies face particular vulnerability due to their possession of detailed personal information combined with regulatory requirements that create time pressure for incident response.\n\nDigital banking platforms and fintech companies represent especially attractive targets due to their technology-forward approaches that may lack the mature security controls of traditional financial institutions while processing substantial financial transactions and maintaining extensive customer databases.\n\nCritical Infrastructure Implications: While ShinyHunters has not directly targeted critical infrastructure systems, their collaboration with other threat actors and proven ability to compromise high-security environments creates potential for operations against power grids, telecommunications networks, and transportation systems. The group's advanced social engineering capabilities could potentially be applied to compromise industrial control systems through manipulation of operational personnel.\n\nRegulatory and Compliance Challenges.\n\nCross-Border Enforcement Limitations: ShinyHunters' international operations across multiple jurisdictions create substantial challenges for law enforcement agencies and regulatory bodies attempting to coordinate response efforts. The group's use of distributed infrastructure, encrypted communications, and jurisdictional shopping complicates traditional law enforcement approaches and creates safe havens for continued operations.\n\nOrganizations must develop compliance strategies that account for the reality that law enforcement may be unable to provide meaningful protection against sophisticated international threat actors, requiring increased reliance on technical controls and proactive security measures rather than deterrence through legal consequences.\n\nData Protection Regulation Evolution: The group's sophisticated data monetization strategies highlight gaps in current data protection regulations that focus primarily on breach notification rather than prevention of criminal data monetization. Organizations face increasing regulatory pressure to implement comprehensive data protection measures that address not only traditional privacy concerns but also criminal exploitation of personal information.\n\nThe evolution of extortion-based attacks creates new regulatory challenges around ransom payment policies, with organizations facing difficult decisions between immediate financial costs and long-term reputational and regulatory consequences of data publication.\n\nEconomic Impact Market Effects.\n\nInsurance Market Disruption: The scale and sophistication of ShinyHunters operations, combined with their high success rate in obtaining ransom payments, is contributing to significant changes in cybersecurity insurance markets. Insurance providers are implementing more stringent security requirements, increasing premiums substantially, and in some cases refusing coverage for organizations deemed high-risk.\n\nThe group's focus on high-value targets with substantial insurance coverage creates an adversarial dynamic where successful attacks against well-insured organizations provide both immediate ransom revenue and market intelligence about insurance policy limits that inform future targeting decisions.\n\nCompetitive Intelligence Risks: ShinyHunters' systematic collection of corporate data creates opportunities for competitive intelligence theft that extends beyond traditional concerns about customer data protection. Organizations must consider the strategic implications of intellectual property, business strategy documents, and competitive information falling into criminal hands where it may be sold to competitors or hostile nation-states.\n\nSupply Chain Security: The group's targeting of technology service providers creates cascading risks throughout supply chains as compromised providers may enable access to their client organizations. This creates complex risk management challenges where organizations must assess not only their direct security posture but also the security capabilities of all critical service providers and the potential for lateral compromise through trusted relationships.\n\nDetection and Mitigation Guidance.\n\nEffective defense against ShinyHunters requires comprehensive security strategies that address both their technical capabilities and sophisticated social engineering techniques. Traditional perimeter-focused security models prove insufficient against threat actors who primarily exploit human vulnerabilities and legitimate system features rather than deploying malicious software or exploiting technical vulnerabilities.\n\nTechnical Detection Strategies.\n\nOAuth Application Monitoring: Organizations must implement comprehensive monitoring of OAuth application creation, modification, and usage patterns to detect malicious applications before they can be exploited for data exfiltration. This includes automated analysis of permission requests, unusual application naming patterns, and usage anomalies that may indicate unauthorized access.\n\nDetection systems should flag OAuth applications requesting excessive permissions, applications created outside normal business processes, and applications exhibiting unusual data access patterns characteristic of bulk data extraction operations. Real-time monitoring of application authorization events can enable rapid response to social engineering attempts before attackers obtain persistent access.\n\nBehavioral Analytics for Cloud Environments: ShinyHunters' sophisticated use of legitimate credentials and authorized applications requires behavioral analytics systems capable of detecting subtle anomalies in user activity patterns. These systems must establish baselines for normal data access patterns and identify deviations that may indicate unauthorized access by external parties using compromised credentials.\n\nSpecific indicators include unusual query patterns, bulk data exports outside normal business hours, access from unexpected geographic locations or network segments, and data access patterns inconsistent with user role requirements. Integration of multiple data sources including authentication logs, application usage telemetry, and network traffic analysis provides comprehensive visibility into potential compromise indicators.\n\nNetwork Traffic Analysis: The group's consistent use of VPN services and Tor networks for operational security creates opportunities for network-based detection through analysis of traffic patterns and destination analysis. Organizations should implement monitoring for connections to known VPN providers, Tor exit nodes, and other anonymization services during sensitive data access operations.\n\nDeep packet inspection and network behavior analysis can identify data exfiltration attempts through monitoring of outbound data flows, particularly large file transfers or database query results being transmitted to external destinations. This analysis must account for legitimate business use of privacy tools while maintaining sensitivity to potential malicious usage patterns.\n\nHuman-Centered Defense Strategies.\n\nAdvanced Social Engineering Training: Traditional security awareness training proves insufficient against ShinyHunters' sophisticated social engineering techniques that exploit human psychology and organizational trust relationships. Organizations require specialized training programs that simulate the specific tactics used by advanced threat actors, including vishing scenarios, impersonation techniques, and pressure tactics designed to bypass natural security instincts.\n\nTraining programs must include realistic simulation exercises where employees experience high-pressure scenarios similar to those employed by ShinyHunters, including impersonation of IT support personnel, urgent business scenarios requiring immediate action, and technical instructions that appear legitimate but enable unauthorized access. Regular testing and reinforcement ensure training effectiveness against evolving social engineering techniques.\n\nVerification and Callback Procedures: Organizations must implement mandatory verification procedures for any requests involving system access, data handling, or security configuration changes, regardless of the apparent authority or urgency of the request. These procedures should include independent verification through established communication channels, multi-person authorization for sensitive operations, and documentation requirements that create audit trails for security-relevant activities.\n\nCallback procedures should require verification of identity through independently obtained contact information rather than information provided by the requestor, multi-step verification processes that include questions only legitimate personnel would know, and escalation procedures for unusual or high-risk requests.\n\nOrganizational Trust Management: ShinyHunters' success relies heavily on exploitation of organizational trust relationships, requiring systematic review and hardening of trust assumptions within business processes. This includes analysis of who has authority to request various actions, what verification requirements exist for different types of requests, and how emergency procedures may be exploited to bypass normal security controls.\n\nOrganizations should implement zero-trust principles for human interactions similar to network security models, requiring verification and authentication for all significant requests regardless of apparent source authority. This cultural shift requires executive leadership support and comprehensive change management to avoid creating operational friction that encourages workaround behaviors.\n\nSystemic Security Architecture.\n\nIdentity and Access Management Hardening: Defense against OAuth abuse and credential-based attacks requires comprehensive identity and access management systems with strong authentication requirements, granular permission controls, and continuous monitoring capabilities. Multi-factor authentication must be mandatory for all administrative functions and configured to resist social engineering attempts that manipulate users into approving illegitimate authentication requests.\n\nPrivileged access management systems should implement just-in-time access provisioning, time-limited permissions for sensitive operations, and automatic revocation of unused access rights. Regular access reviews and automated analysis of permission usage patterns can identify both over-privileged accounts and unusual access patterns that may indicate compromise.\n\nData Loss Prevention and Encryption: Comprehensive data loss prevention systems must account for authorized users extracting data through legitimate applications, requiring content-aware monitoring that can identify sensitive data regardless of the extraction method. These systems should implement automatic classification of sensitive data, monitoring of data movement patterns, and real-time blocking of unauthorized data transfers.\n\nEncryption strategies must address both data at rest and data in motion, with particular attention to ensuring that encrypted data cannot be accessed by unauthorized applications even when users possess legitimate system credentials. Key management systems must prevent credential compromise from enabling widespread data decryption.\n\nIncident Response and Recovery: Organizations must develop incident response procedures specifically designed for sophisticated social engineering attacks where traditional indicators of compromise may be absent. These procedures should include rapid OAuth application review processes, emergency access revocation capabilities, and comprehensive forensic analysis that can identify the full scope of data access even when attackers use legitimate credentials and applications.\n\nRecovery procedures must address both immediate containment of ongoing access and long-term remediation of compromised trust relationships, potentially requiring complete rebuilding of authentication systems and re-evaluation of all access permissions. Organizations should maintain offline backup systems that cannot be accessed through normal network credentials to ensure recovery capabilities even in cases of comprehensive credential compromise.\n\nFuture Outlook.\n\nThe trajectory of ShinyHunters' operations indicates continued evolution toward increasingly sophisticated, targeted attacks that blend advanced technical capabilities with masterful social engineering to compromise even the most security-conscious organizations.\n\nTheir successful adaptation to law enforcement pressure through organizational decentralization and operational innovation suggests sustained threat levels despite periodic disruptions, while their collaboration networks and influence within cybercrime ecosystems amplify their impact far beyond direct operations.\n\nTactical Evolution Predictions.\n\nEnhanced Artificial Intelligence Integration: Future operations will likely incorporate artificial intelligence technologies to improve social engineering effectiveness, automate reconnaissance activities, and optimize data processing and monetization strategies.\n\nAI-powered voice synthesis and conversation management could enable more convincing vishing campaigns with reduced human resource requirements, while machine learning algorithms could automate identification of high-value data within compromised systems.\n\nNatural language processing capabilities may enable automated analysis of corporate communications to identify optimal extortion timing, key decision-makers, and pressure points that maximize ransom payment probability. These technologies could also enable personalized social engineering campaigns tailored to specific individuals based on comprehensive analysis of their digital footprints and behavioral patterns.\n\nSupply Chain and Third-Party Integration Attacks: The group's demonstrated expertise in exploiting trust relationships suggests future focus on supply chain attacks that leverage compromised service providers to access multiple downstream targets simultaneously. Software-as-a-service providers, managed security service providers, and other trusted third parties represent high-value targets that provide access to hundreds or thousands of client organizations through single successful compromises.\n\nThese attacks may involve long-term persistent access to service provider systems followed by strategic deployment against specific high-value clients, creating complex attribution challenges and enabling coordinated attacks against entire industry sectors.\n\nAdvanced Persistent Extortion Models: Current trends toward delayed extortion and comprehensive data collection suggest evolution toward more sophisticated extortion models that maintain access for extended periods while continuously collecting intelligence about victim organizations. Future operations may involve systematic collection of competitive intelligence, regulatory compliance documentation, and internal communications that provide multiple leverage points for extortion demands.\n\nThis approach could enable tiered extortion strategies where initial ransom demands focus on data publication prevention, followed by additional demands related to competitive intelligence, regulatory violation evidence, or other compromising information collected during extended access periods.\n\nIndustry and Geographic Expansion.\n\nCritical Infrastructure Targeting: The group's increasing sophistication and collaboration with nation-state-affiliated actors create potential for operations against critical infrastructure systems including power grids, telecommunications networks, and transportation systems. These targets offer both substantial ransom potential and strategic value for nation-states seeking to demonstrate capabilities or conduct preparatory operations for future conflicts.\n\nCritical infrastructure attacks may involve extended reconnaissance periods, development of specialized attack tools, and coordination with other threat actors possessing complementary capabilities such as industrial control system expertise or insider access. The intersection of financial motivation with strategic objectives creates complex threat scenarios that challenge traditional defensive assumptions.\n\nEmerging Market Focus: Geographic analysis suggests potential expansion into emerging markets where cybersecurity capabilities may be less mature while economic development creates attractive targets with substantial data holdings. Financial services organizations, telecommunications providers, and government agencies in developing regions may face particular risk due to rapid digitization combined with limited security expertise and infrastructure.\n\nThese markets may also offer operational advantages including less sophisticated law enforcement capabilities, limited international cooperation mechanisms, and regulatory environments that provide additional leverage for extortion operations.\n\nRegulatory Arbitrage Operations: The group's demonstrated ability to operate across multiple jurisdictions suggests potential development of regulatory arbitrage strategies that exploit differences in cybercrime laws, data protection regulations, and law enforcement capabilities between countries.\n\nOperations may be specifically designed to maximize complications for law enforcement while exploiting regulatory pressure on victim organizations.\n\nThis could include targeting organizations subject to strict data protection regulations with operations conducted from jurisdictions with limited cybercrime enforcement, creating maximum pressure for rapid ransom payment to avoid regulatory penalties.\n\nEcosystem Impact and Influence.\n\nMethodology Proliferation: ShinyHunters' successful techniques are already being adopted by numerous other threat actors, creating a multiplication effect that extends their impact throughout the cybercrime ecosystem. Their social engineering playbooks, OAuth abuse techniques, and extortion strategies provide templates for less sophisticated criminals to conduct similar operations against smaller targets.\n\nThis proliferation effect creates industry-wide risk elevation as defensive measures must account not only for ShinyHunters' direct operations but also for dozens of imitator groups employing similar techniques with varying levels of sophistication. The democratization of advanced attack techniques through criminal forums and collaboration networks accelerates this proliferation process.\n\nCriminal Infrastructure Development: The group's extensive forum administration and ecosystem management activities suggest continued development of criminal infrastructure that enables and amplifies threat actor capabilities globally. Future developments may include specialized service markets, automated attack platforms, and comprehensive support ecosystems that lower barriers to entry for cybercriminal operations.\n\nThis infrastructure development creates positive feedback loops where successful operations generate resources that fund development of more sophisticated capabilities, creating exponential growth in overall ecosystem threat levels. The intersection of profit motivation with infrastructure investment suggests sustained growth in criminal capabilities that outpaces defensive development.\n\nLaw Enforcement Adaptation Challenges: The group's successful adaptation to law enforcement pressure through organizational decentralization and operational innovation suggests that traditional law enforcement approaches may prove insufficient against sophisticated, international cybercrime organizations.\n\nFuture operations may be specifically designed to exploit limitations in international cooperation, jurisdictional boundaries, and legal frameworks that constrain law enforcement effectiveness.\n\nThis evolution toward law enforcement-resistant operational models may inspire other threat actors to adopt similar approaches, creating systemic challenges for cybercrime enforcement that require fundamental changes in international cooperation mechanisms and legal frameworks.\n\nThe success of decentralized criminal organizations challenges traditional assumptions about law enforcement deterrence and creates demand for innovative protective strategies that do not rely primarily on legal consequences.\n\nAppendices.\n\nIndicators of Compromise (IOCs).\n\nNetwork Indicators:\n\n\nEmail addresses: shinygroup@tuta.com, contact-shinycorp-tutanota-com@[redacted].\n\nMalicious domains:

to this week’s edition of the Threat Source newsletter. \n\n_This is the way the world ends_   \n_This is the way the world ends_   \n_This is the way the world ends_   \n_Not with a bang but a whimper._ – T.S. Eliot \n\nSo this is how Summer Camp 2025 ends, not with a bang but a whimper. We’ve put the summer behind us and are moving on to the next phase of the year, where we all put our noses down and grind from here to the holiday season. Happy Grind Season 2025.\n\nAs you know, threat research never takes a day off, but I’m going to step in and remind you all to look at your calendars. Decide, here and now, to take some time before that holiday season so that you can take care of your mental health, because mental health _is_ health.\n\nThis is doubly important if you lead a team of people. Take a minute and make sure that they are going to do the same. Ensure your entire team is taking care of themselves. In the end, you will all be better for it. \n\nSince we are on the subject of mental health, I don’t know if anyone else has read this paper [(Psychopathia Machinalis: A Nosological Framework for Understanding Pathologies in Advanced Artificial Intelligence)][1], but I found it truly fascinating. It’s one of the things we, as security practitioners, need to be cognizant of as we go forward with our AI tooling and efforts to protect against AI threats. \n\n_\"As artificial intelligence (AI) systems attain greater autonomy and complex environmental interactions, they begin to exhibit behavioral anomalies that, by analogy, resemble psychopathologies observed in humans.\"_ \n\nThe behavior of an evolving AI, and the psychosis it could present, is a touch-point to the long-standing problematic internal employee. This creates an interesting dynamic for defense and strategies within the evolving internal landscape. \n\nI think understanding this presented framework can go a long way in identifying the types of behaviors that lead to malicious activity — not unlike understanding employee behavior. Stay ahead of the curve and prepare for not only a hallucinated package from an internal AI tool but perhaps a revelation that leads to new and interesting malicious behaviors.\n\n## The one big thing \n\nIn the latest episode of [The Talos Threat Perspective,][2] we explore three vulnerabilities that Talos researchers uncovered (and helped to fix) this year which highlight how attackers are pushing past the boundaries defenders rely on. One lived in the security chip within Dell laptops’ firmware, another in Microsoft Office for macOS permissions and the third in small office/home routers. \n\n### Why do I care? \n\nThese aren’t just isolated issues. The Dell vulnerability showed that even a clean Windows reinstall isn’t always enough to kick out an attacker. The Office for macOS issue demonstrated how adversaries can “borrow” sensitive permissions like microphone access from trusted apps. And compromised routers allowed attackers to blend in with legitimate ISP traffic, making malicious connections hard to spot. Each case reveals current attacker creativity levels. \n\n### So now what? \n\nTake a closer look at the research:\n\n* Watch the full Talos Threat Perspective episode here: [TTP Ep14: Persistence, Privilege & Camouflage][2]\n* Read Philippe’s blog on the Dell firmware vulnerabilities: [Revault: When your SOC turns against you][3]\n\n## Top security headlines of the week \n\n**TransUnion says hackers stole 4.4 million customers’ personal information**   \nTransUnion is one of the largest credit reporting agencies in the United States, and stores the financial data of more than 260 million Americans.

This report delivers a comprehensive analysis of the TinkyWinkey Keylogger, highlighting its use of advanced Windows system programming techniques, such as service management, low-level keyboard hooks, process handling, and system information collection. TinkyWinkey operates stealthily as both a service and an executable, capturing extensive system data including CPU specifications, memory, OS version, and network details, while continuously monitoring active windows and keyboard layouts. The malware employs low-level hooks to record all keystrokes, accurately handling special keys, media keys, and Unicode characters across multiple languages. Its loader performs reliable DLL injection into trusted processes, and a dedicated service thread ensures persistent execution of the payload within the user session. First observed June 24–25, TinkyWinkey exemplifies sophisticated keylogging and system monitoring capabilities, making it a high-value target for threat intelligence and mitigation efforts.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nTinkyWinkey is a Windows-based project demonstrating a Windows service and keylogger system. It consists of two main components:\n\n* Tinky Service: Manages and launches the keylogger, providing service lifecycle operations (install, start, stop, delete) and running the keylogger in the active user session.\n* Winkey Keylogger: Captures keyboard input and gathers system information, either as a standalone executable or a DLL injected into other processes.\n\nTechnologies & APIs: C/C++, MSVC, NMAKE, Windows x86/x64, using SCM API, Windows Hooks API, Terminal Services API, Winsock2, and File API.\n\n## Key Features\n\n**System Information Gathering:** Collects CPU details (vendor, model, architecture, core count), Windows version and build, RAM size, and local IP address.\n\n**Keylogging:** Implements low-level keyboard hooks to capture all input, including alphanumeric, function, navigation, modifier, special, and media keys; supports Unicode and detects keyboard layout changes.\n\n**Window Tracking:** Monitors foreground window changes and logs window titles with timestamps.\n\n**Logging System:** Writes all data to UTF-8 encoded log files with timestamp integration.\n\n**Service Management:** Provides full control over the Tinky service lifecycle.\n\n**Process & Session Management:** Launches winkey.exe in the user session for stealthy execution.\n\n## STATIC ANALYSIS\n\n#### Persistent Keylogging Storage\n\nThe malware retrieves the system’s temporary directory by calling GetTempPathW() and appending the filename logs\\_tw.txt by calling CreateFileW() with OPEN\\_ALWAYS, ensuring the log file is created if it does not exist. Using SetFilePointer(), the file handle is moved to the end, enabling append mode logging. Captured keystrokes are written into this file through WriteFile(), with the function write\\_to\\_file() serving as the logging routine.\n\n#### System Profiling Routine\n\nIt then subsequently invokes multiple information-gathering functions, such as get\\_windows\\_info(), get\\_cpu\\_info(), get\\_ip\\_address(), and get\\_ram\\_info(), which are responsible for collecting host system details, including OS version, processor information, network identifiers, and memory capacity.\n\n#### Direct OS Fingerprinting\n\nThe function get\\_windows\\_info() leverages the undocumented RtlGetVersion API from ntdll.dll to query the operating system’s version information. Instead of using standard Windows APIs like GetVersionEx() (which can be inaccurate due to application compatibility shims), the malware retrieves a direct pointer to RtlGetVersion via GetProcAddress(). It then populates the RTL\\_OSVERSIONINFOW structure with details, such as major version, minor version, and build number.\n\n#### Comprehensive CPU Enumeration\n\nThe get\\_cpu\\_info() function collects detailed processor information through a combination of low-level instructions and Windows API calls. It first invokes the \\_\\_cpuid intrinsic, extracting the CPU vendor string and extended brand string to identify the exact processor model. The function concatenates results from multiple CPUID calls (0x80000002–0x80000004) to reconstruct the full CPU brand name. It then calls GetSystemInfo() to retrieve system-level details such as the processor architecture (x86, x64, ARM, etc.) and the number of logical processors.\n\n#### Network Identity Discovery\n\nThe get\\_ip\\_address() function enables the malware to enumerate the victim machine’s network identity. It initializes Winsock (WSAStartup) and retrieves the local system’s hostname using gethostname(). The hostname is then resolved into an IPv4 address via getaddrinfo().\n\n#### Memory Capacity Enumeration\n\nThe get\\_ram\\_info() function collects details about the victim machine’s physical memory. It leverages the Windows API GlobalMemoryStatusEx() to query total system resources, specifically the size of installed physical RAM. The value returned (ullTotalPhys) is converted into megabytes and written to the malware’s log file via write\\_to\\_file()\n\n#### Foreground Window Monitoring\n\nA WinEventHook on EVENT\\_SYSTEM\\_FOREGROUND is set to detect whenever the user switches active applications. This lets the attacker map keystrokes to specific applications (e.g., browser, email client, banking portal), enhancing the value of stolen credentials.\n\n#### Global Keystroke Capture\n\nThe malware installs a low-level keyboard hook (WH\\_KEYBOARD\\_LL) that captures all keystrokes across the system.\n\n#### Keyboard Layout Tracking\n\nThe malware monitors the active keyboard layout (HKL). If the user switches languages (e.g., English → Russian), the malware logs the new layout. This helps attackers understand what language or character set the victim is typing in, making the stolen keystrokes more meaningful.\n\n#### Capturing Keystroke Events\n\nIt intercepts keyboard events from the low-level hook. For each key press (WM\\_KEYDOWN), it extracts the virtual key code (vkCode) and converts it into a readable format. Special keys (Escape, Enter, Space, Backspace, etc.) are replaced with descriptive markers like \\[ESC\\] or \\[ENTER\\] in the log.\n\n#### Character Logging\n\nFor non-special keys, the malware retrieves the current keyboard state (GetKeyboardState) and converts the virtual key code and scan code into a Unicode character using ToUnicode(). It then converts the resulting character into UTF-8 (WideCharToMultiByte) and writes it to the log file via its logging routine. This ensures that normal alphanumeric and symbol input is captured accurately, reflecting modifiers like Shift or Caps Lock, and supports multi-language environments.\n\n#### Message Loop and Hook Cleanup\n\nFinally, it enters a continuous message loop (GetMessage, TranslateMessage, DispatchMessage) to keep its foreground window and keyboard hooks active. This ensures persistent monitoring of user activity until termination. Upon exit, it unregisters the hooks (UnhookWinEvent, UnhookWindowsHookEx) to clean up resources, preventing system instability or leaving traces in memory. This design maintains stealthy and continuous keylogging operations.\n\n#### DLL MODULE\n\nKeylogger.dll is the primary payload responsible for low-level keystroke capture, foreground window correlation, keyboard layout tracking, and structured log emission. It is designed to be injected into a trusted process. The DLL initializes global hooks, registers window-focus notifications, and persists a message loop to continuously process input events.\n\n#### Payload Verification Logging\n\nThe loader creates a log file in the temporary folder to record errors and status messages. It also verifies that the malicious DLL (keylogger.dll) exists in the same directory as the loader before proceeding, ensuring the payload is available for injection.\n\n#### Target Process Identification\n\nThe loader first identifies the PID of the target process (explorer.exe) using FindTargetPID. Once identified, the malware obtains a handle to the process with full access rights, enabling memory allocation, thread creation, and DLL injection. If the process is not found, it logs an error and exits.\n\n#### Remote Memory Allocation\n\nThe loader allocates a memory block inside the target process using VirtualAllocEx, sized to store the full DLL path. This memory will hold the path of the DLL to be loaded remotely. Failure to allocate memory halts the injection, preventing instability or crashes in the target process.\n\n#### Writing DLL Path & Creating Remote Thread\n\nThe loader writes the DLL path into the allocated memory and creates a remote thread in the target process using LoadLibraryW. This forces the target process to load and execute the DLL in its own context. Errors in memory writing or thread creation are logged, and the process is safely cleaned up.\n\nAfter the remote thread is launched, the loader waits for it to complete using WaitForSingleObject. Logging a success message provides confirmation that the DLL injection was completed without errors. This technique ensures stealthy and reliable DLL execution within a trusted process.\n\n#### Persistence Technique: Windows Service\n\nThe Service worker thread (ServiceWorkerThread()) is responsible for launching the malware payload (winkey.exe) in the active user session. It first retrieves the service executable’s path and extracts its directory to construct the full path to the payload. It then prepares the STARTUPINFO structure, specifying the winsta0\\\\default desktop and hiding the window (SW\\_HIDE) to ensure stealthy execution. The PROCESS\\_INFORMATION structure is initialized to receive process handles, and CreateProcessAsUser is called with the duplicated user token (htoken) to run winkey.exe in the user’s context. This allows the malware to execute invisibly with user privileges, while maintaining control over the process.\n\nThe WinMain function acts as the primary execution entry point for TinkyWinkey. It manages service lifecycle operations-installation, start, stop, and deletion-via command-line arguments, while defaulting to automatic execution under the Service Control Manager (SCM). This dual-mode design ensures persistent execution of the keylogger across system reboots, enabling stealthy monitoring of user activity and system information.\n\n## DYNAMIC ANALYSIS\n\nUpon execution, svc.exe registers a malicious Windows service named “Tinky”. The service is configured with an automatic startup type, enabling the malware to achieve persistence by ensuring that the service is invoked every time the system boots. This guarantees that the keylogger remains active without requiring user interaction.\n\nAfter establishing persistence, svc.exe proceeds to execute the secondary payload winkey.exe, which is the primary keylogging module, responsible for monitoring user activity in real time. It continuously intercepts keystrokes, tracks active foreground window titles, and captures additional contextual data that could enhance the value of the stolen information.\n\nDuring its operation, the malware creates a log file in the user’s temp directory named Logs\\_tw.txt. This file acts as a central repository where both system reconnaissance details (such as OS version, hostname, and hardware information) and user activity data (keystrokes and window focus changes) are recorded. The structured nature of the log file allows the attacker to easily parse and exfiltrate sensitive data, including credentials, chat communications, and other confidential input.\n\n## EXTERNAL THREAT LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT\n\nOn June 24–25, the TinkyWinkey – Yet Another Windows 10 Keylogger was identified, and believed to be published by a user, who claims to be based in Lyon, France.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nTinkyWinkey represents a highly capable and stealthy Windows-based keylogger that combines persistent service execution, low-level keyboard hooks, and comprehensive system profiling to gather sensitive information. Its ability to capture all keystrokes, including special keys and multi-language input, alongside detailed system metrics such as CPU, memory, OS version, and network identifiers, underscores the sophistication of modern malware targeting endpoint systems. The loader’s use of DLL injection into trusted processes and service-based persistence highlights the challenge of detection and mitigation. First observed in late June 2025, this malware exemplifies the evolving threat landscape, where attackers leverage advanced programming techniques to maintain stealth and maximize data capture. Organizations should remain vigilant by monitoring unusual service activity, unexpected DLL injections, and persistent logging patterns. Proactive threat intelligence, continuous endpoint monitoring, and rapid response mechanisms are critical to minimizing exposure and safeguarding sensitive user and system data against such sophisticated threats.\n\n## IOCs\n\n| **Indicator**                                                        | **Type** | **Remarks**   |\n|

This includes Keychain passwords, system details, desktop files, and macOS passwords.\n\nThe malware is able to steal data from multiple browsers, including auto-fills, passwords, cookies, wallets, and credit card information. AMOS can target multiple cryptowallets such as Electrum, Binance, Exodus, Atomic, and Coinomi.\n\nBetween June and Aug 2025, CrowdStrike blocked over 300 SHAMOS attacks by the cybercrime group COOKIE SPIDER. Sold as malware-as-a-service, SHAMOS was spread via malvertising, luring victims to fake macOS help sites and tricking them into running a malicious one-line install command. \n\n_“Operating as malware-as-a-service, COOKIE SPIDER rents this information stealer to cybercriminals who deploy it to harvest sensitive information and cryptocurrency assets from victims. The campaign utilized malvertising to direct users to fraudulent macOS help websites where victims were instructed to execute a malicious one-line installation command.” reads the [report][3] published by CrowdStrike. “This campaign underscores the popularity of malicious one-line installation commands among eCrime actors”_\n\nThis technique bypasses Gatekeeper checks, installing Mach-O executables. It highlights cybercrime’s growing reliance on such commands, also seen in prior Cuckoo Stealer and SHAMOS Homebrew campaigns.\n\nIn June 2025, a malvertising campaign lured users searching macOS help (e.g., “flush resolver cache”) to fake sites. Victims spanned in Canada, China, Colombia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the US, the UK, and other countries, but none in Russia, likely because Russian operators of MaaS ban targeting Russia and CIS countries.\n\nThreat actors spoofed an Australia-based store in Google Ads to promote fake macOS help sites (mac-safer\\[.\\]com, rescue-mac\\[.\\]com). Victims were tricked into executing a malicious one-line command in Terminal that decoded a Base64 string, stole passwords, and installed SHAMOS malware from icloudservers\\[.\\]com. \n\n_“The command decodes the Base64-encoded string `aHR0cHM6Ly9pY2xvdWRzZXJ2ZXJzLmNvbS9nbS9pbnN0YWxsLnNo` and downloads a file from `https[:]//icloudservers[.]com/gm/install[.]sh`.” reads the [report][3] published by CrowdStrike._\n\n_“This file is a Bash script that captures the user’s password and downloads a SHAMOS Mach-O executable from `https[:]//icloudservers[.]com/gm/update`.”_\n\nSince June 2025, CrowdStrike has tracked continued use of such malvertising campaigns, often disguised as free macOS tools, using either plain text or Base64-encoded URLs.\n\nSHAMOS installs itself in the _/tmp/_ directory, stripping file attributes to bypass Apple’s Gatekeeper protections before making itself executable. It runs checks to avoid sandboxes and then uses AppleScript to scan the system, searching for cryptocurrency wallets, Keychain data, AppleNotes, and browser credentials. Stolen files are packed into _out.zip_ and sent out via _curl_. The malware also downloads extra payloads, including a fake Ledger Live app and a botnet module, hiding them in the user’s home directory. To stay persistent, it creates a _com.finder.helper.plist_ file in LaunchDaemons if it has Sudo access. Frequent _curl_ activity shows its botnet module in action.\n\n_“This campaign highlights that leveraging malvertising and the one-line installation-command technique to distribute macOS information stealers remains popular among eCrime actors.” concludes the report. “Promoting false malicious websites encourages more site traffic, which will lead to more potential victims. The one-line installation command enables eCrime actors to directly install the Mach-O executable onto the victim’s machine while bypassing Gatekeeper checks.”_\n\n[Pierluigi

Targeted companies included U.S. and foreign global oil and gas firms, utility and electrical grid companies, nuclear power plants, renewable energy companies, consulting and engineering groups, and advanced technology firms.” reads the page on [Rewards for Justice][3] website published for each of officer._\n\nThe three officers are all members of the FSB’s Center 16 unit (aka [Dragonfly][4], Berzerk Bear, Energetic Bear, and [Crouching Yeti][5]).\n\nIn August 2021, the US DoJ charged the three FSB officers (Pavel Aleksandrovich Akulov, Mikhail Mikhailovich Gavrilov, and Marat Valeryevich Tyukov).\n\nBetween 2012 and 2017, the [Dragonfly][4] APT conducted multiple attacks targeting ICS or Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems used in the energy industry, including oil and gas firms, nuclear power plants, as well as utility and power transmission companies.\n\nAccording to the indictment, the campaign against the energy sector involved two phases. In the first phase, which took place between 2012 and 2014, the nation-state actor was tracked as “Dragonfly” or “Havex” and engaged in a supply chain attack, compromising OT network system manufacturers and software providers deploying the “[Havex][6]” implant.\n\nThe attackers also launched spear-phishing and “watering hole” attacks that allowed them to install malware on more than 17,000 unique devices in the United States and abroad, including ICS/SCADA controllers used by power and energy companies.\n\nIn the second phase, which took place between 2014 and 2017, the APT group tracked as “[Dragonfly 2.0][7]” focused on more targeted attacks on specific energy sector entities and individuals and engineers who worked with ICS/SCADA systems. The group targeted more than 3,300 users at more than 500 U.S. and international companies and entities, in addition to U.S. Government agencies such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n\nIn August 2025, the FBI [warned][8] that Russia-linked threat actor Static Tundra exploits Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and end-of-life networking devices running an unpatched vulnerability ([CVE-2018-0171][9]) in Cisco Smart Install (SMI) to target organizations in the United States and globally.\n\n[CVE-2018-0171][10] (CVSS score of 9.8) affects the Smart Install feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software. The flaw could be exploited by an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of a vulnerable device or to execute arbitrary code on an affected device.\n\n_“The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is warning the public, private sector, and international community of the threat posed to computer networks and critical infrastructure by cyber actors attributed to the Russian Federal Security Service’s (FSB) Center 16.” reads the [alert][11] issued by the FBI. “The FBI detected Russian FSB cyber actors exploiting Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and end-of-life networking devices running an unpatched vulnerability (CVE-2018-0171) in Cisco Smart Install (SMI) to broadly target entities in the United States and globally.”_\n\nStatic Tundra is a Russia-linked actor linked to the FSB’s Center 16 unit that has been active for over a decade. The cyber espionage group specializes in compromising network devices for long-term intelligence gathering operations.\n\nOver the past year, the FBI observed FSB’s Center 16, aka [Berserk Bear][12]/[Dragonfly][13], collecting configs from thousands of U.S. critical infrastructure devices. The hackers altered some configs for backdoor access and reconnaissance, showing interest in ICS-related protocols. Active for over a decade, they exploit weak legacy protocols (SMI, SNMP v1/v2) and deploy tools like the Cisco “SYNful Knock” malware.\n\nAccording to Talos researchers, victims are primarily based in Ukraine and allied countries,\n\n“The group actively exploits a seven-year-old vulnerability (CVE-2018-0171), which was patched at the time of the vulnerability publication, in Cisco IOS software’s Smart Install feature, targeting unpatched and end-of-life network devices to steal configuration data and establish persistent access.” reads a [report][14] published by Cisco Talos.\n\n“Primary targets include organizations in telecommunications, higher education and manufacturing sectors across North America, Asia, Africa and Europe, with victims selected based on their strategic interest to the Russian government.”\n\nStatic Tundra exploits unpatched Cisco IOS/IOS XE devices via CVE-2018-0171 and weak SNMP strings to gain persistent access, exfiltrate configs, and support long-term espionage. Using bespoke tools, SYNful Knock implants, and GRE tunnels, they prioritize stealth, persistence, and intelligence gathering.\n\nSYNful Knock is a modular, stealthy router firmware backdoor that ensures persistence, evades detection, and uses non-standard packets for authentication. The backdoor [was first detailed][15] in 2015 by Mandiant.\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][16]\n\n([SecurityAffairs][17] – hacking, FSB officers)\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\n[1]:

the latest discoveries in cyber research for the week of 1st September, please download our [Threat Intelligence Bulletin][1].\n\n**TOP ATTACKS AND BREACHES**\n\n* American consumer credit reporting agency TransUnion has [suffered][2] a data breach that resulted in the exposure of sensitive personal information for over 4.4 million individuals in the United States. The leaked data includes names, billing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, unredacted Social Security Numbers, transaction reasons, and customer support messages.\n* Miljödata, a major Swedish IT provider, has [disclosed][3] a cyber attack that resulted in service disruptions to over 200 Swedish municipalities. The attack raised concerns over the theft of sensitive personal data, including medical certificates, rehabilitation cases, and occupational injury reports.\n* Healthcare Services Group has [suffered][4] a data breach that resulted in the unauthorized access and exfiltration of sensitive personal information from its network. The incident impacted approximately 624,000 individuals, exposing data that may include full names, Social Security numbers, driver’s license and state identification numbers, financial account details, and account credentials.\n* The Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) has [experienced][5] a cyber attack that resulted in disruption of Mobility paratransit service. The attack affected scheduling systems and related real-time information and call-center systems, preventing users from booking trips.\n* The State of Nevada has [confirmed][6] a cyber attack that resulted in widespread disruption of services. The attack affected governmental websites, phone systems, and online platforms, forcing the closure of all state offices and impacting the availability of various state technology systems.\n* Nissan has [suffered][7] a data breach that resulted in four terabytes of sensitive design studio data being stolen from its subsidiary Creative Box Inc. These include 3D vehicle models, financial documents, VR workflows, and photos. The breach impacts Nissan only, exposing proprietary experimental and concept vehicle designs but no external clients or contractors. Qilin ransomware group claimed responsibility for the attack and published samples of the stolen information.\n\n_Check Point Threat Emulation and Harmony Endpoint provide protection against this threat_ _(Ransomware.Wins.Qilin.\\*)_\n\n* Farmers Insurance has [disclosed][8] a data breach that resulted in the theft of sensitive customer information, including names, addresses, dates of birth, driver’s license numbers, and/or the last four digits of Social Security numbers. The breach impacted 1,111,386 customers.\n* Auchan has [suffered][9] a data breach that resulted in unauthorized access to sensitive data from several hundred thousand customer loyalty accounts. The personal information exposed includes full names, titles, client status, postal addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, and loyalty card numbers. No banking data, passwords, or PINs were compromised in the incident.\n\n**VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHES**\n\n* WhatsApp has [released][10] a patch for a zero-click authorization vulnerability (CVE-2025-55177) affecting iOS and Mac versions of the app, which allowed attackers to process content from arbitrary URLs via abused linked device synchronization messages. This vulnerability, exploited in targeted zero-day attacks, was used alongside an Apple OS-level flaw (CVE-2025-43300) in sophisticated spyware campaigns against select users. Successful exploitation enabled remote code execution.\n* Citrix has [fixed][11] a critical remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2025-7775) in NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway, which was exploited as a zero-day via a memory overflow bug allowing unauthenticated RCE on unpatched systems. Additional patched vulnerabilities include CVE-2025-7776 (memory overflow, DoS) and CVE-2025-8424 (improper access control).\n* Passwordstate, a password manager used by over 29,000 organizations, has [released][12] a patched version, addressing a high-severity authentication bypass vulnerability. The flaw allows threat actors to craft a malicious URL targeting the Emergency Access page, granting unauthorized access to the administration section, and does not yet have a CVE ID.\n* Google has [released][13] a security update for Google Chrome, addressing CVE-2025-9478, a critical use after free vulnerability in ANGLE. Malicious attackers could craft websites to trigger memory corruption and achieve remote code execution.\n\n**THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORTS**\n\n* Check Point Research [revealed][14] the ZipLine campaign, a sophisticated phishing operation targeting US supply chain-critical manufacturing companies by leveraging legitimate-appearing business interactions initiated through corporate “Contact Us” forms. The attack involves multi-week email exchanges, followed by the delivery of the custom MixShell implant. Technical analysis reveals advanced persistence mechanisms, dynamic payload customization, and infrastructure spoofing.\n* Check Point Research have [uncovered][15] an active campaign attributed to the Silver Fox APT group that abuses newly discovered and previously known vulnerable, Microsoft-signed kernel drivers. This in order to terminate protected security processes and evade EDR/AV detection on fully updated Windows 10/11 systems. The attackers employ a dual-driver strategy for cross-version compatibility, embedding both drivers in a single loader, which incorporates anti-analysis measures and ultimately delivers the ValleyRAT remote access trojan.\n* Check Point researchers [uncovered][16] an active phishing campaign in which threat actors abused Google Classroom’s invitation system to send over 115,000 phishing emails targeting 13,500 organizations across the globe within a single week. The attackers distributed fake Google Classroom invitations containing commercial offers, directing recipients to communicate via WhatsApp. This allowed them to bypass enterprise monitoring and leverage Google’s legitimate infrastructure to evade security measures.\n\n\n[1]: https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Threat%5FIntelligence%5FNews%5F2025-09-01.pdf\n[2]:

IoT under siege: The return of the Mirai-based Gayfemboy Botnet\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][1]  August 24, 2025 \n\n## Mirai-based Gayfemboy botnet resurfaces, evolving to target systems worldwide; Fortinet researchers provided details about the new campaign.\n\nFortiGuard Labs researchers tracked a new [Gayfemboy][2] botnet campaign, the malware exploits known flaws in DrayTek, TP-Link, Raisecom, and Cisco, showing evolved tactics and renewed activity.\n\nThe Gayfemboy botnet was first identified in February 2024, it borrows the code from the basic [Mirai][3] variant and integrates N-day and 0-day exploits.\n\nBy November 2024, Gayfemboy exploited 0-day vulnerabilities in Four-Faith industrial routers and Neterbit routers and Vimar smart home devices, with over 15,000 daily active nodes. Operators behind the botnet also launched DDoS attacks against researchers tracking it.\n\nIn January 2025, QiAnXin XLab experts [observed][2] the Gayfemboy delivering its bot by exploiting more than 20 vulnerabilities, they also attempted to exploit Telnet weak credentials. The researchers discovered that attackers targeted the zero-day vulnerability [CVE-2024-12856][4] in Four-Faith industrial routers along with several unknown vulnerabilities affecting Neterbit and Vimar devices.\n\nIn July 2025, FortiGuard Labs found a Gayfemboy payload exploiting multiple device flaws. Attacks originated from IPs 87\\[.\\]121\\[.\\]84\\[.\\]34 and 220\\[.\\]158\\[.\\]234\\[.\\]135\\. The experts identified the downloader scripts for multiple devices targeted by the bot, including Asus, Vivo, Zyxel, and Realtek. The malicious code fetched malware and XMRig miners, with product names passed as parameters to Gayfemboy for execution.\n\n_“Gayfemboy employs its first layer of obfuscation during the file download stage. Unlike [Mirai][3] and [Gafgyt][5] variants, which typically use Linux architecture names as file extensions, Gayfemboy assigns distinct names to each architecture, avoiding predictable naming conventions.” reads the [report][6] published by Fortinet Labs._\n\nThe Gayfemboy botnet targets multiple countries, including Brazil, Mexico, the United States, Germany, France, Switzerland, Israel, and Vietnam. Experts observed victims in multiple sectors, such as Manufacturing, Technology, Construction, and Media or Communications.\n\nGayfemboy malware employs custom file naming to evade detection and obfuscates binaries with a modified UPX header. The malware kills rival malware processes. It has four core modules: Monitor (anti-analysis, persistence, sandbox evasion, process-killing), Watchdog (ensures single instance, kills unresponsive copies), Attacker (DDoS and backdoor functions), and Killer (removes competing infections).\n\n_“Within the **Monitor** function, Gayfemboy includes two dedicated sub-functions: **Self-Persistence** and **Sandbox Evasion**. **Self-Persistence** ensures the malware remains active. If Gayfemboy detects that its process has been terminated, it automatically re-executes itself.” continues the report. “As part of its **Sandbox Evasion** technique, Gayfemboy introduces a deliberate delay of 50 nanoseconds. If executed in a sandbox environment that cannot accurately handle such a fine-grained delay, the timing function fails, causing the malware to misinterpret the result and initiate a fallback sleep of approximately 27 hours.”_\n\nGayfemboy connects to its C2 by resolving random domains (e.g., _cross-compiling\\[.\\]org_, _furry-femboys\\[.\\]top_) via public DNS (1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8) to evade local filtering. It scans 15 ports to establish communication and supports lightweight 4-byte commands (reset, sleep, info) plus extended commands like payload download, reverse shell, firewall rule changes, and launching DDoS. Self-protection includes clock-based sandbox checks and a remote **^kill^** command.\n\n_“While Gayfemboy inherits structural elements from Mirai, it introduces notable modifications that enhance both its complexity and ability to evade detection. This evolution reflects the increasing sophistication of modern malware and reinforces the need for proactive, intelligence-driven defense strategies.” concludes the report that includes Indicators of Compromise. “Staying ahead requires not only regular patching but also in-depth analysis and exposure of emerging threats to develop effective countermeasures and mitigate risk.”_\n\n[Pierluigi

China linked UNC6384 targeted diplomats by hijacking web traffic\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][1]  August 27, 2025 \n\n## The China-linked APT group UNC6384 targeted diplomats by hijacking web traffic to redirect it to a website that delivered malware.\n\nChina-linked cyberespionage group UNC6384 targeted diplomats by hijacking web traffic to redirect to a website used to deliver malware, Google’s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) warns.\n\nCyberspies hijacked a network’s captive portal using an advanced adversary-in-the-middle ([AitM][2]) technique to deliver malware. GTIG links the group, UNC6384, to the Chinese threat actor TEMP.Hex, also known as [Mustang Panda][3].\n\nIn March 2025, Google identified a sophisticated cyber espionage campaign by UNC6384, targeting diplomats in Southeast Asia and globally. The attack hijacked web traffic via captive portal redirects, delivering a signed downloader (STATICPLUGIN) that installed the [PlugX backdoor][4] (SOGU.SEC). \n\nGTIG found that attackers hijacked captive portals to deliver malware disguised as an Adobe Plugin update. \n\nThe attackers trick targets into downloading malware disguised as a “plugin update” via a fake software update site using HTTPS and a valid TLS certificate. The page appears legitimate, displaying a blank landing page with an “Install Missing Plugins…” button. When clicked, JavaScript triggers the download of “AdobePlugins.exe” while showing a background image with execution instructions. The fake installer runs, but the SOGU.SEC backdoor is already active, bypassing Windows security.\n\nLegitimate browser redirects (via gstatic.com) were abused in an adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attack, likely through compromised edge devices, though the initial compromise method remains unknown.\n\n_“A captive portal is a network setup that directs users to a specific webpage, usually a login or splash page, before granting internet access. This functionality is intentionally built into all web browsers. The Chrome browser performs an HTTP request to a hardcoded URL (`“http://www.gstatic.com/generate204`”) to enable this redirect mechanism.” states the GTIG’s [**report**][5]._\n\n_“While “`gstatic.com`” is a legitimate domain, our investigation uncovered redirect chains from this domain leading to the threat actor’s landing webpage and subsequent malware delivery, indicating an AitM attack. “_\n\nUpon delivery to a Windows system, the malware launches a multi-stage chain designed to evade defenses and remain stealthy. The first stage, STATICPLUGIN, is a digitally signed downloader disguised as a legitimate installer. It retrieves an MSI package, which installs CANONSTAGER, a launcher that side-loads and executes the encrypted SOGU.SEC backdoor entirely in memory.\n\nCANONSTAGER employs advanced evasion techniques, including API hashing, Thread Local Storage (TLS) for storing function addresses, and indirect code execution via Windows message queues and hidden window procedures. This allows SOGU.SEC to decrypt and run without leaving artifacts on the disk, bypassing security tools while maintaining communication with the attacker’s command-and-control server. The malware leverages legitimate Windows features and digitally signed binaries to appear credible and avoid detection.\n\n_“This campaign is a clear example of the continued evolution of UNC6384’s operational capabilities and highlights the sophistication of PRC-nexus threat actors.

The following are some statistics and cases included in the original report.\n\n**1) Statistics of Phishing Email Threats**\n\nIn July 2025, the most common type of threat among phishing email attachments was phishing (60%). Threat actors used scripts such as HTML to mimic the screen layout, logo, and font of login pages and promotional pages. Users are then prompted to enter their account credentials, which are then sent to the threat actor’s C2 server or used to redirect the victims to fake websites. This type of phishing also involves inserting hyperlinks into documents such as PDF files to redirect users to phishing websites created by threat actors.\n\n**Figure 1\\. Phishing email threat statistics**\n\nIn addition, data on the distribution changes of samples by category over the past six months has been provided, reflecting the recent trends in threats posed by phishing emails. Furthermore, statistics on the extensions of attachments found in phishing emails have been included, allowing readers to understand the file formats used in these emails. These statistics and more can be found in the original ATIP report.\n\n**2) Distribution of Korean Emails**\n\nThis section covers cases of phishing emails written in Korean, and provides the titles and file names of attachments from these samples. This information allows readers to identify the frequently used keywords in phishing email threats.\n\n**Figure 2\\. Some of the phishing emails in Korean**\n\n**3) Analysis of Phishing Email Distribution Cases**\n\nRepresentative cases were analyzed according to the attachment format (Script, Document, Compress). Through this, users can check the phishing email attack cases that actually occurred this month. This month, not only phishing pages (FakePage) were distributed through Script attachments, but also malware exploiting the vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882) by executing the document file (exploit) was distributed via phishing emails. When the document file is executed, the vulnerability of the equation editor (EQNEDT32.EXE) (CVE-2017-11882) is exploited to execute Lokibot malware. Recently, there has been an increase in cases where a PE file (.exe) is compressed in a ZIP file and distributed via phishing emails. Additional information such as the C2 address, analysis information, and the body of the phishing email that distributed the malware can be found in the original ATIP report and ATIP Notes.\n\n**Figure 3\\. Malware distributed as an attachment in Document format**\n\n**Figure 4\\. Malware distributed as an attachment in Compress format**\n\nThis post reveals a part of the July 2025 Trends Report on Phishing Email. The original ATIP report contains additional content, including the recent distribution trends of phishing (FakePage) and malware, statistics on and distribution of attachments by extension, and analysis on actual phishing email attacks.   \n\n※ For more information, please refer to the attached file.\n\n MD5 \n\n01f68e02af2a9314bf20a84f722cd993\n\n05a32454a16cfefa3f5e59130dd4f1ce\n\n10fd66045df61ec16daffaffb8fb7eb2\n\n1df34f8ebe0921f773d2436be887ed36\n\n1f83b3a18059ef735cc594445bd142e4","modified_at":null,"source_file":null,"customFields":[],"published_at":"2025-08-12T00:00:00+00:00","encryption_alg":null,"linked_reports":null,"linked_victims":null,"created_by_user":null,"linked_malwares":[{"id":"80ca963e-d0b9-3e9c-8ae5-0972a505bf22","name":"Loki Password Stealer","tags":[],"last_seen":null,"created_at":"2023-08-10T08:00:00+00:00","first_seen":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","updated_at":"2025-08-29T15:05:16.012+00:00","channel_ids":[],"description":null,"modified_at":null,"collected_at":"2023-09-06T01:08:52.405+00:00","endpoint_ids":[1],"malware_type":["keylogger","backdoor","dropper","remote-access-trojan","unknown","ransomware","trojan"],"linked_reports":["8a292451-a275-329d-ba31-3610de7b2824","3277772f-8a88-3805-b161-cfd760be782b","1679e87d-8d9e-38ff-b82c-e5edd2b09b30","a121ba18-07c4-3660-ac6a-fa55af209b90","0706790e-6d3c-3ab8-818a-dc11ab6834f9","baec528b-b620-32ea-870d-9a9131c42ba5","49c55ee8-b947-33f4-b5d4-b0e17c2c30c7","9306b18a-05af-37de-a559-6ef1817a8b00","a223c820-2bc1-32e4-866f-794d82bab7e6","35d52853-24bc-3223-89e6-91e13e6c8442","74075864-599b-35e6-be10-ba47df09961a","faf1ecbe-f851-3ebb-ad9c-afd608cb2ec8","2071fd18-ecfb-3d53-a7ba-33e8e466404f","b6965ded-ccc9-3609-85fd-94ea9e2dd2e8","67520b72-11cd-35d9-bfb7-f90397f7342a","423cd4e7-0300-3a88-8572-b342c0a6f03b","d0d9cb92-7340-3d9a-901b-b66dc0108fdb","575f9d85-5df1-3e22-8898-996ececc6857"],"linked_victims":[],"linked_malwares":[],"linked_campaigns":[],"kill_chain_phases":null,"linked_identities":[],"linked_techniques":[],"linked_observables":[],"linked_threat_actors":[],"linked_vulnerabilities":[]}],"linked_campaigns":null,"programming_lang":null,"victim_countries":["KOR"],"linked_identities":null,"victim_industries":null,"linked_observables":[{"id":"2283427c-79c0-313e-b12c-958003f1621a","asn":null,"bik":null,"tags":[],"type":"md5","alias":null,"owner":null,"score":null,"value":"1f83b3a18059ef735cc594445bd142e4","expire":null,"country":null,"category":null,"platform":null,"user_ids":[],"incidents":null,"is_active":true,"last_seen":null,"mask_type":null,"registrar":null,"tip_score":null,"created_at":"2025-08-12T00:00:00+00:00","first_seen":null,"industries":[],"updated_at":"2025-08-29T15:05:16.012+00:00","attack_type":null,"channel_ids":[],"description":"This post reveals a part of the July 2025 Trends Report on Phishing Email.

An attacker who is an authenticated user on the same intranet as the session recording server can exploit this flaw.\n\n[CVE-2024-8068][5] is a privilege escalation to NetworkService Account access in Citrix Session Recording. An attacker who is an authenticated user in the same Windows Active Directory domain as the session recording server domain can exploit this flaw.\n\n[CVE-2025-48384][6] vulnerability resides in Git’s handling of configuration values and stems from how it processes carriage return (CR) characters. When Git writes a config entry, it does not properly preserve trailing CR values, leading to subtle alterations in paths that include them.\n\nThis becomes dangerous during submodule initialization: if the submodule path contains a trailing CR, Git interprets it incorrectly and checks out the submodule to the wrong location. An attacker could exploit this by creating a symlink from the altered path to the submodule’s **hooks** directory. If the submodule also contains a malicious, executable `post-checkout` hook, the script would run automatically after checkout—without the user’s awareness. \n\nThis flaw could enable remote code execution in scenarios where repositories with maliciously crafted submodules are cloned.\n\nAccording to [Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities][7], FCEB agencies have to address the identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect their networks against attacks exploiting the flaws in the catalog.\n\nExperts also recommend that private organizations review the [Catalog][3] and address the vulnerabilities in their infrastructure.\n\nCISA orders federal agencies to fix the vulnerabilities by September 15, 2025.\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][8]\n\n([SecurityAffairs][9] – hacking, [cisa][10])\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\n[1]: https://securityaffairs.com/author/paganinip\n[2]:

FBI: Russia-linked group Static Tundra exploit old Cisco flaw for espionage\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][1]  August 21, 2025 \n\n## FBI warns FSB-linked group Static Tundra is exploiting a 7-year-old Cisco IOS/IOS XE flaw to gain persistent access for cyber espionage.\n\nThe FBI warns that Russia-linked threat actor Static Tundra exploits Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and end-of-life networking devices running an unpatched vulnerability ([CVE-2018-0171][2]) in Cisco Smart Install (SMI) to target organizations in the United States and globally.\n\n[CVE-2018-0171][3] (CVSS score of 9.8) affects the Smart Install feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software. The flaw could be exploited by an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of a vulnerable device or to execute arbitrary code on an affected device.\n\n_“The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is warning the public, private sector, and international community of the threat posed to computer networks and critical infrastructure by cyber actors attributed to the Russian Federal Security Service’s (FSB) Center 16.” reads the [alert][4] issued by the FBI. “The FBI detected Russian FSB cyber actors exploiting Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and end-of-life networking devices running an unpatched vulnerability (CVE-2018-0171) in Cisco Smart Install (SMI) to broadly target entities in the United States and globally.”_\n\nStatic Tundra is a Russia-linked actor linked to the FSB’s Center 16 unit that has been active for over a decade. The cyber espionage group specializes in compromising network devices for long-term intelligence gathering operations.\n\nOver the past year, the FBI observed FSB’s Center 16, aka [Berserk Bear][5]/[Dragonfly][6], collecting configs from thousands of U.S. critical infrastructure devices. The hackers altered some configs for backdoor access and reconnaissance, showing interest in ICS-related protocols. Active for over a decade, they exploit weak legacy protocols (SMI, SNMP v1/v2) and deploy tools like the Cisco “SYNful Knock” malware.\n\nAccording to Talos researchers, victims are primarily based in Ukraine and allied countries,\n\n“The group actively exploits a seven-year-old vulnerability (CVE-2018-0171), which was patched at the time of the vulnerability publications, in Cisco IOS software’s Smart Install feature, targeting unpatched and end-of-life network devices to steal configuration data and establish persistent access.” reads a [report][7] published by Cisco Talos.\n\n“Primary targets include organizations in telecommunications, higher education and manufacturing sectors across North America, Asia, Africa and Europe, with victims selected based on their strategic interest to the Russian government.”\n\nStatic Tundra exploits unpatched Cisco IOS/IOS XE devices via CVE-2018-0171 and weak SNMP strings to gain persistent access, exfiltrate configs, and support long-term espionage. Using bespoke tools, SYNful Knock implants, and GRE tunnels, they prioritize stealth, persistence, and intelligence gathering. \n\nSYNful Knock is a modular, stealthy router firmware backdoor that ensures persistence, evades detection, and uses non-standard packets for authentication. The backdoor [was first detailed][8] in 2015 by Mandiant.\n\n_“Static Tundra has been observed modifying TACACS+ configuration on compromised devices, hindering remote logging capabilities. Static Tundra also modifies access control lists (ACLs) to permit access from specific IP addresses or ranges under their control.” continues Talos’s report. “Static Tundra likely uses publicly-available scan data from services such as Shodan or Censys to identify systems of interest. Once inside a target environment, Static Tundra relies heavily on native commands, such as “show cdp neighbors”, to reveal additional systems of interest within the target environment. This presents a relatively stealthy way to identify further targets without the need for active scanning.”_\n\nCisco recommends that organizations apply security updates for CVE-2018-0171 or disable Smart Install as a temporary mitigation.\n\nCisco’s Talos also published Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) for this campaign.\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][9]\n\n([SecurityAffairs][10] – hacking, Static

Docker fixes critical Desktop flaw allowing container escapes\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][1]  August 25, 2025 \n\n## Docker fixed a critical flaw in the Docker Desktop app for Windows and macOS that could potentially allow an attacker to escape the confines of a container.\n\nDocker fixed a critical vulnerability, tracked as [CVE-2025-9074][2] (CVSS score of 9.3), impacting Docker Desktop app for Windows and macOS. An attacker can exploit the flaw to potentially escape the confines of a container.\n\nAccording to DockerDoc, a malicious container could access the Docker Engine and launch containers without the socket, risking host file access, even with Enhanced Container Isolation (ECI) enabled.\n\n“A vulnerability was identified in Docker Desktop that allows local running Linux containers to access the Docker Engine API via the configured Docker subnet, at 192.168.65.7:2375 by default. This vulnerability occurs with or without Enhanced Container Isolation (ECI) enabled, and with or without the “Expose daemon on tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS” option enabled. This can lead to execution of a wide range of privileged commands to the engine API, including controlling other containers, creating new ones, managing images etc.” [reads the advisory][2]. “In some circumstances (e.g. Docker Desktop for Windows with WSL backend) it also allows mounting the host drive with the same privileges as the user running Docker Desktop.”\n\nThe vulnerability, tracked as **[CVE-2025-9074][2]**, carries a CVSS score of 9.3 out of 10.0\\. It has been addressed in version 4.44.3.\n\nThe vulnerability was discovered by the researchers Felix Boulet and Philippe Dugre (zer0x64).\n\nResearcher Felix Boulet discovered that the flaw allows containers to connect to Docker Engine API (192.168.65.7:2375) without authentication. A PoC shows any container can issue requests to bind the host’s C:\\\\ drive, then start a container with read/write access to host files, leading to full host compromise.\n\n_“At its core, this vulnerability was a simple oversight, Docker’s internal HTTP API was reachable from any container without authentication or access controls.It’s a stark reminder that critical security gaps often stem from the most basic assumptions. I found this issue by running a quick nmap scan against the Docker’s documented private network.” [Boulet wrote][3]. “Scanning all private range subnet takes only minutes and might show you that you weren’t as isolated as you thought.Always test your network isolation assumptions and do not trust that all security models are alligned by default.”_\n\nDugre [found][4] the Docker Desktop flaw on Windows lets attackers mount the full file system as admin, read sensitive data, or overwrite DLLs to gain host control. The experts explained that macOS is safer due to isolation, though attackers can still backdoor Docker configs. Linux isn’t impacted since it uses a named pipe. Exploitation can come from malicious containers or via SSRF to proxy requests to the Docker socket.\n\n_“While the easiest way to exploit it is via a vulnerable or malicious container that’s controlled by the attacker, another attack vector that can be used here is Server-Side Request Forgery(SSRF).” [wrote Dugre][4]. “This vulnerability allows an attacker to proxy requests through the vulnerable application and reach the docker socket, the impact of which varies especially depending on the availability of HTTP requests methods (most SSRF only allows GET requests, but some niche case allows the use of POST, PATCH, DELETE methods).”_\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][5]\n\n([SecurityAffairs][6] – hacking, Container Escape Vulnerability)\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\n[1]:

Pakistan-linked APT36 abuses Linux .desktop files to drop custom malware in new campaign\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][1]  August 25, 2025 \n\n## APT36 uses Linux .desktop files in new attacks on Indian gov & defense, aiming for data theft and persistent espionage access.\n\nTransparent Tribe (aka [APT36][2], Operation C-Major, and Mythic Leopard), a Pakistan-linked threat actor, is using Linux .desktop files to load malware in new attacks against government and defense entities in India.\n\nThe APT group is targeting Indian government entities via spear-phishing emails deploying custom malware for persistent espionage.\n\nAPT36’s latest campaign uses a malicious archive “Meeting\\_Notice\\_Ltr\\_ID1543ops.pdf\\_.zip” containing a disguised .desktop file flagged on VirusTotal. \n\nThe shortcut masquerades as a PDF but executes hidden commands via Bash. The “.desktop” file mimics a PDF but hides malicious commands in its Exec= line. It downloads a hex-encoded payload from securestore\\[.\\]cv, decodes and executes it silently, while showing a benign PDF in Firefox as a decoy. Disguised with a PDF icon, set to run as an application, and enabled for autostart, it ensures persistence and stealth, letting malware operate unnoticed.\n\nThe campaign was uncovered on August 1, 2025, and is still ongoing. \n\nThe analyzed file is a suspicious 64-bit ELF executable for x86-64, statically linked, with anomalies like a huge section header offset, missing section names, and irregular segments typical of malware packing. It embeds the hardcoded C2 “modgovindia\\[.\\]space:4000” and ensures persistence via cron jobs and systemd service abuse. On execution, it connects to the C2, using DNS queries and UDP sockets for stealthy communication, enabling data exfiltration and attacker control.\n\nThe Operation Transparent Tribe (Operation C-Major, APT36, and Mythic Leopard) was first spotted by Proofpoint Researchers in Feb 2016, in a series of cyber espionage operations against Indian diplomats and military personnel in some embassies in Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan. At that time, the researchers tracked the sources IP in Pakistan, the attacks were part of a wider operation that relies on multi-vector such as watering hole websites and phishing email campaigns delivering custom RATs dubbed Crimson and Peppy. These RATs are capable of exfiltrate information, take screenshot, and record webcam streams.\n\nTransparent Tribe has been active since at least 2013, it targeted entities across 27 countries, most of them in Afghanistan, Germany, India, Iran, and Pakistan.\n\nTransparent Tribe (APT36) was first spotted in 2016 targeting Indian diplomats and military staff via phishing and watering hole attacks. Linked to Pakistan, it used custom RATs like Crimson and Peppy to exfiltrate data, capture screenshots, and record webcams. The group has targeted entities in 27 countries, mainly India, Afghanistan, Germany, Iran, and Pakistan.\n\n_“While Indian government entities remain the primary focus, APT36 has extended operations to adjacent sectors (education, research, and civil society), as well as opportunistic targeting in other geographies. This broad victimology increases the attack surface and introduces risk to partners, suppliers, and diplomatic missions abroad.” concludes the [report][3] published by CYFIRMA. “The adoption of .desktop payloads targeting Linux BOSS reflects a tactical shift toward exploiting indigenous technologies. Combined with traditional Windows-based malware and mobile implants, this shows the group’s intent to diversify access vectors and ensure persistence even in hardened environments.”_\n\n[Pierluigi

shortcut masquerades as a PDF but executes hidden commands via Bash. The \".desktop\" file mimics a PDF but hides malicious commands in its Exec= line. It downloads a hex-encoded payload from  securestore.cv , decodes and executes it silently, while showing a benign PDF in Firefox as a decoy. Disguised with a PDF icon, set to run as an application, and enabled for autostart, it ensures persistence and stealth, letting malware operate unnoticed. The campaign was uncovered on August 1, 2025, and is still ongoing.\nTogether, these attributes support a classic social-engineering rule. Enabling X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true ensures that the file automatically runs every time the user logs in, granting the attacker persistence on the system. Combined with stealthy execution and a convincing disguise, this multistage mechanism allows the attacker to deliver and run malware, maintain access, and potentially perform further malicious operations without triggering immediate detection by the user. Domain Analysis Domain \" securestore.cv \" has been identified as a part of the malicious infrastructure actively leveraged in cyber espionage campaigns attributed to the APT36 (Transparent Tribe) threat group, which is assessed to be operating out of Pakistan.

It embeds the hardcoded C2 \"  modgovindia.space :4000\" and ensures persistence via cron jobs and systemd service abuse. On execution, it connects to the C2, using DNS queries and UDP sockets for stealthy communication, enabling data exfiltration and attacker control. The Operation Transparent Tribe (Operation C-Major, APT36, and Mythic Leopard) was first spotted by Proofpoint Researchers in Feb 2016, in a series of cyber espionage operations against Indian diplomats and military personnel in some embassies in Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan. At that time, the researchers tracked the sources IP in Pakistan, the attacks were part of a wider operation that relies on multi-vector such as watering hole websites and phishing email campaigns delivering custom RATs dubbed Crimson and Peppy.\nUpon execution, the malware enables the system-update.service for the current user, ensuring it is automatically started during future user-level systemd sessions. The malware establishes persistence by quietly inserting a cron job that executes the hidden payload '.config/systemd/systemd-update' on every system reboot. This ensures the malicious code automatically restarts after system reboots or process termination. Subsequently, the malware established command-and-control (C2) communication with the domain \"  modgovindia.space \", which resolves to the IP address  45.141.58.199 , over port 4000. The observed activity involves low-level socket operations used by malware to perform DNS queries for command-and-control (C2) communication.\n\nIt creates a non-blocking UDP socket, enables broadcast, and connects to the local DNS resolver at  127.0.0.53 :53. Using epoll for efficient event handling, the malware sends DNS queries, such as for the suspicious domain  modgovindia.space , and attempts to read responses non-blockingly. Futex system calls indicate synchronization in a multithreaded context. This behavior points to DNS-based reconnaissance or communication with a malicious server as part of a C2 infrastructure. The malware attempts to transmit harvested data to the attacker's infrastructure, indicating the presence of an active bidirectional command-and-control (C2) channel that facilitates both the retrieval of instructions and the exfiltration of information.\n\nDomain Analysis The domain \"  modgovindia.space \" has been flagged as malicious by multiple detection engines and is assessed to be associated with APT36 activity. The domain  modgovindia.space , registered on 8 July 2025 via Namecheap and hosted on IP  45.141.58.199 by Seychelles-based IP Connect Inc., is assessed as likely malicious due to its recent registration and infrastructure commonly used in malware or phishing campaigns. EXTERNAL THREAT LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT. APT36, also known as Transparent Tribe or Mythic Leopard, is a Pakistan-linked cyber-espionage group that has been active for over a decade, with campaigns becoming increasingly sophisticated since 2016.\n\nThese files are designed to masquerade as legitimate documents while covertly communicating with recently registered malicious domains such as \"securestore.cv\" and \"  modgovindia.space \" to download and execute secondary payloads. Both domains exhibit characteristics typical of disposable threat infrastructure and have been flagged as malicious by multiple threat-intelligence sources. The group's ability to rapidly deploy tailored payloads and infrastructure demonstrates increasing sophistication and underscores the need for heightened vigilance, particularly around spear-phishing vectors and Linux-based attack surfaces. Recommendations and Mitigation. Recommendations and Mitigation Strategies\n\nTo mitigate the ongoing APT36 campaign targeting Indian Government entities through weaponized .desktop files and associated malicious domains, the following measures are formally recommended: 1. Email Security Enhancements Deploy advanced email security solutions capable of detecting spear-phishing emails that contain .desktop, .sh, .elf, and compressed archive attachments. Disable automatic execution of email attachments and apply sandbox-based detonation of suspicious files prior to delivery. Enable URL filtering to block connections to newly registered or malicious domains (e.g., securestore.cv,  modgovindia.space ).\n\nIndicators of Compromise. Kindly refer to the IOCs section, applying relevant security controls.

Pierluigi Paganini August 25, 2025 APT36 uses Linux .desktop files in new attacks on Indian gov and defense, aiming for data theft and persistent espionage access. Transparent Tribe (aka APT36, Operation C-Major, and Mythic Leopard), a Pakistan-linked threat actor, is using Linux .desktop files to load malware in new attacks against government and defense entities in India. The APT group is targeting Indian government entities via spear-phishing emails deploying custom malware for persistent espionage. APT36's latest campaign uses a malicious archive \" Meeting_Notice_Ltr_ID1543ops.pdf_.zip \" containing a disguised .desktop file flagged on VirusTotal.\nBy adopting a dual-platform delivery strategy, APT36 seeks to maximize its reach and ensure sustained, covert access to critical government infrastructure while circumventing conventional security mechanisms. Malware Campaign Attack Flow. In this campaign, the group distributes an Archive file named \" Meeting_Notice_Ltr_ID1543ops.pdf_.zip \". When opened, it contains a .desktop file named \" Meeting_Ltr_ID1543ops.pdf.desktop \" (Linux shortcut file). The .desktop file has been flagged as highly malicious on VirusTotal, with multiple antivirus engines consistently identifying it as associated with malware or unauthorized execution behavior.","entity_type":["observable"],"mitre_attrs":["command-and-control","defense-evasion","initial-access"],"modified_at":null,"collected_at":"2025-08-29T14:37:39.706+00:00","endpoint_ids":[1],"last_op_date":null,"provider_ids":[],"activity_type":[],"bank_card_cvv":null,"bank_card_dump":null,"bank_card_type":null,"linked_reports":["3e9daf9f-d9ae-34ba-aff0-c32d6c497eb1","1c131eb6-8a2f-3ae1-898d-445d7add9ac6"],"linked_victims":[],"linked_malwares":[],"activity_periods":null,"bank_card_issuer":null,"bank_card_system":null,"linked_campaigns":[],"account_passwords":null,"linked_identities":[],"operations_number":null,"linked_observables":[],"enrichment_services":[],"payment_system_name":null,"bank_card_valid_thru":null,"linked_threat_actors":[],"virustotal_detections":null,"linked_vulnerabilities":[]}],"linked_threat_actors":[{"id":"493d42ab-141c-33cf-b075-fd6466361e45","name":"Operation C-Major","tags":null,"goals":["political","password theft","information theft","unauthorized access","espionage"],"aliases":["APT 36","TEMP.Lapis","TEMP","Transparent Tribe","MYTHIC LEOPARD","APT36","TMP.Lapis","C-Major","Green Havildar","ProjectM","COPPER FIELDSTONE","Mythic Leopard","PROJECTM"],"user_ids":null,"countries":["RUS","PAK","CHN"],"last_seen":"2025-08-25T00:00:00+00:00","created_at":null,"first_seen":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","industries":["government"],"motivation":null,"updated_at":"2025-09-12T07:35:22.288+00:00","channel_ids":null,"description":null,"modified_at":null,"collected_at":"2023-10-31T09:17:34.06+00:00","endpoint_ids":[1],"provider_ids":null,"linked_reports":["45d2fc5c-9f25-345c-8054-5d277f32e381","e9bbcea4-c8ef-30e6-93ee-da14028db8dd","81abc470-6fd2-32f9-86ec-d89a13734fc7","3e9daf9f-d9ae-34ba-aff0-c32d6c497eb1","4172a997-4f97-3cc5-83d7-60a8dfafb60d","ec20a095-010d-34b6-954c-3205032c05d3","e32e6794-49c3-3a29-bf31-6582878c5719","e643d4a5-a6f5-3f81-bb9a-9c2c0712141d","267e9808-2c1e-3f74-90d4-83279b07669c","993759b4-1da9-353c-8c18-47811367d1bb","36d7907c-af31-3f0a-93fe-7f0ab1a83987","9fbaecb4-1553-3d74-8e92-7a7d5a04ef66","1c131eb6-8a2f-3ae1-898d-445d7add9ac6","a78a53cc-8e2c-3784-a9d5-16445449bea7","3fdf36fe-3093-3162-8d6a-0608472db9e5","c9c80dee-bd38-3d4c-bc6c-84967c9586a0","0ea347ce-1b17-3d91-bc84-b42582bc1ae5","12b711ab-f760-337c-835e-b6a06665a826","e813b609-8445-31f1-9250-746a6ab24b21","4852f33a-72f6-392a-aa4d-d32dd76cf810","63b04b32-85a1-3cfc-a4a2-839aa4f3dfa4"],"linked_victims":null,"linked_malwares":null,"linked_campaigns":null,"kill_chain_phases":null,"linked_identities":null,"linked_techniques":null,"linked_observables":null,"linked_threat_actors":null,"linked_vulnerabilities":null}],"linked_vulnerabilities":null,"threat_actor_countries":["PAK"],"threat_actor_industries":null},{"id":"81abc470-6fd2-32f9-86ec-d89a13734fc7","name":"Security Affairs newsletter Round 538 by Pierluigi Paganini – INTERNATIONAL EDITION","tags":[],"goals":null,"authors":[],"is_read":null,"sources":{"userIds":[],"channelIds":[],"endpointIds":[1],"enrichmentServices":null},"countries":[],"created_at":"2025-08-24T00:00:00+00:00","industries":[],"description":"## Security Affairs newsletter Round 538 by Pierluigi Paganini – INTERNATIONAL EDITION\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][1]  August 24, 2025 \n\n## A new round of the weekly Security Affairs newsletter has arrived!

to this week’s edition of the Threat Source newsletter. \n\nAs summer retreats into the rear-view mirror, I’d like to take a moment to reflect on one of my favorite things about the cybersecurity profession: the community. Earlier this month, I attended [Black Hat USA 2025][1] and [DEF CON 33][2] in scalding hot Las Vegas, NV. We often refer to it as “hacker summer camp,” where all the security nerds of various stripes congregate to eat, drink, party, hack and reforge or make new bonds of fellowship with other awesome hackers. Hacker summer camp is, simply put, a whirlwind of activity, from the talks to see, villages to visit, parties to attend, and knowledge to gain. In 5 days, I think I walked almost 30 miles. By the end I was exhausted, but happy to have learned so much and see many of my hacker friends. \n\nFor all the fun and learning you can have at summer camp, it's a very privileged position to be able to attend. Las Vegas is [not a cheap town][3]. Hotels, flights and food — everything, really — is more expensive than average. A Black Hat badge is $1,000+, and DEF CON $500+. If you’re new to this space and early in your career, or your company doesn’t have the money to send you, the FOMO can be real. Earlier in my career, getting the opportunity to visit hacker summer camp — either with my company covering my costs or me paying out of pocket — wasn’t going to happen. \n\nI bring this up not to flex that I went to BH/DEF CON, but to tell you that as good as those conferences are, there is [_so much more_][4]_._ Do not be daunted by what is inaccessible but know that there are other conferences out there for like-minded hackers who want to learn and share knowledge with you, wherever you are in the world. Are you in high school? I promise you there are [clubs and organizations][5] there to help you. College? There are student clubs and organizations there that will welcome you. And if you’re looking for projects and [contests][6], there are quite a few out there. And [hackathons][7]? [I got you covered][8], fam. \n\nIt’s also important to know that there are smaller information security conferences around the world. Perhaps the most popular and usually super local is Bsides. [Check them out][9] — their website has a calendar that might have one local to you. \n\nInfosec is as much a calling as it is a career. You were drawn to this space for a reason — and finding friends and colleagues who match your vibe is important to both grow as a human, but also to maintain a healthy relationship with this industry, especially one that’s notoriously capable of burning you out. We as humans are social creatures, and we need social interaction, even if it’s limited doses (I see you, introverts). Our professions are a natural magnet to pull others into our orbit. I can tell you so many of the things that I consider personal career milestones happened because I talked with fellow security practitioners over drinks or a meal, and something [truly wonderful happened][10]. \n\nSo go find your people, lean into the things you are a total security nerd about, and enjoy the fellowship and growth. You’ll be all the better for it.\n\n## The one big thing \n\nLast week, [Talos shared that ransomware attacks in Japan][11] surged by about 1.4 times in the first half of 2025, with small and medium-sized companies (especially manufacturing) being the hardest hit. The Qilin group was the most active, and a new player, \"Kawa4096,\" also began targeting Japanese businesses. Even though some major ransomware groups were shut down, new threats are quickly taking their place. \n\n### Why do I care? \n\nThe ransomware landscape is always changing, and it often highlights vulnerabilities in small and mid-sized businesses in critical industries like manufacturing. With new ransomware groups like Kawa4096 emerging and techniques evolving, the risks are growing, and attackers are finding new ways to target organizations that may not have strong defenses.\n\n### So now what? \n\nWhile small- to mid-size manufacturing companies are the most targeted in Japan, it’s important for all businesses to stay updated on threats, invest in cybersecurity, and train their teams to spot suspicious activity. ClamAV detections are also available in the [blog][11].\n\n## Top security headlines of the week \n\n**Organizations warned of exploited Git vulnerability**   \nThe US cybersecurity agency CISA on Monday warned that the flaw, tracked as CVE-2025-48384 (CVSS score of 8.1), is an arbitrary file write during the cloning of repositories with submodules that use a ‘recursive’ flag. ([SecurityWeek][12]) \n\n**CISA updates SBOM recommendations**   \nThe document is primarily meant for federal agencies, but CISA hopes businesses will also use it to push vendors for software bills of materials. ([Cybersecurity Dive][13]) \n\n**AI-powered ransomware: \"PromptLock”**   \nAlthough it has not yet been observed in active cyberattacks, the researchers said the PromptLock ransomware appears to be under development and nearly ready to be unleashed onto the threat landscape. ([Dark Reading][14]) \n\n**Credential harvesting campaign targets ScreenConnect cloud administrators**   \nThe campaign uses compromised Amazon Simple Email Service accounts to spear-phish senior IT administrators who have elevated privileges in ScreenConnect environments. ([Cybersecurity Dive][15]) \n\n**Security researcher maps hundreds of TeslaMate servers spilling Tesla vehicle data**   \nA security researcher has found over a thousand publicly exposed hobby servers run by Tesla vehicle owners that are spilling sensitive data about their vehicles, including their granular location histories. ([TechCrunch][16])\n\n## Can’t get enough Talos? \n\n* [**State of Identity Security Report**][17]  \nCisco Duo’s global survey of 650 Security & Data Ops leaders shows where orgs succeed, and where they’re exposed. Download the full report now.\n* [**Static Tundra exposed**][18]  \nA Russian state-sponsored group, Static Tundra, is exploiting an old Cisco IOS vulnerability to compromise unpatched network devices worldwide.\n\n## Upcoming events where you can find Talos \n\n* [BlueTeamCon][19] (Sept. 4 – 7) Chicago, IL\n* [LABScon][20] (Sept. 17 – 20) Scottsdale, AZ\n* [VB2025][21] (Sept. 24 – 26) Berlin,

ransomware group launches continuous ransomware attacks against companies from various countries and industries. This post describes the analysis and characteristics of Interlock ransomware.\n\n**1\\. Overview**\n\n**1.1 Interlock Profiles**  \nInterlock ransomware group first emerged at the end of September 2024, and has been continuously attacking various businesses and critical infrastructures in North America and Europe. Like other ransomware gangs, the group encrypts files of infected systems, steals sensitive data of victim companies, and publicly discloses the data if the ransom is not paid.\n\n  \n\\[Figure 1\\] DLS Home Page of Interlock Ransomware Group’s Interlock Ransomware Group’s DLS Home Page (.onion)\n\n**1.2 Interlock Malware**\n\nInterlock ransomware uses the AES-256-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) algorithm to encrypt files. The symmetric key and initial value IV are encrypted using RSA-4096 public key and inserted at the end of the file. The public key is included in the file in advance, so if the attacker can identify the file, decryption is possible using the private key. In particular, this encryption process is implemented based on the OpenSSL library, effectively combining AES and RSA algorithms through high-performance encryption processing and key management functions to encrypt files. This structure enhances the sophistication and efficiency of encryption, making data recovery for victims difficult. After the file encryption operation, no separate network communication occurs. In other words, the attacker designed the ransomware malware to make decryption impossible with only the remaining traces in the local environment.\n\nThe ransom note includes the negotiation site URL based on the Tor network, and the victim is encouraged to negotiate directly with the attacker by accessing the site. The ransom note also warns of the potential violation of major legal regulations such as GDPR, GLBA, HIPAA, CCPA, NYDFS Cyber Security Regulations, DPA 2018, and pressures the victim through threatening messages that the network intrusion was successful.\n\n**2 Analysis Details**\n\n## 2.1 Initial Routine\n\nInterlock ransomware initially encrypts or obfuscates the main code and hides it, only to perform code patching at the execution time to release it in memory. Since the original code of the ransomware appears in memory only at the moment of execution, it can evade detection while operating normally. In other words, the initial code patch is presumed to be a defensive measure of ransomware concealing its core logic, aiming at delaying analysis and avoiding security.\n\nAfter the code patch is completed, the actual main code first checks the arguments and, if there are no arguments, attempts to encrypt all drives and enable access to symbolic links. The activation of symbolic links is to access files linked by lnk or symbolic link for encryption.\n\n| **Arguments**     | **Behavior**                                         |\n| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |\n| \\-d <folder path> | Attempt to encrypt specified folder                  |\n| \\-f <file name>   | Encrypt one file only                                |\n| \\-t               | Test value                                           |\n| \\-e               | Treat multiple values as a single set                |\n| \\-s               | Create and run task scheduler (privilege escalation) |\n| \\-r               | Attempt to encrypt forcibly                          |\n| \\-del             | Self-delete                                          |\n\n\\[Table 1\\] Behaviors per Value\n\n## 2.2 File Encryption\n\nTo prevent system damage due to encrypting critical files, set folders, extensions, and files to be excluded from encryption. The lists are as shown in the below tables 2, 3, and 4.\n\nFor the extensions and files excluded from encryption, specify the encryption infection extensions used by Interlock ransomware as the encryption exclusion target such as “!NT3RLOCK” and “OPEN\\_BEFORE\\_ANYTHING.txt” to prevent re-infecting already encrypted files. The Ransom Note is also specified as an encryption exclusion target to allow victims to review the Ransom Note and proceed with negotiations.\n\n| **Folders Excluded from Encryption**        |\n| ------------------------------------------- |\n| $Recycle.Bin / $RECYCLE.BIN                 |\n| Boot                                        |\n| Documents and Settings                      |\n| PerfLogs                                    |\n| ProgramData                                 |\n| Recovery                                    |\n| System Volume Information                   |\n| Windows                                     |\n| $RECYCLE.BIN                                |\n| AppData                                     |\n| WindowsApps                                 |\n| Windows Defender                            |\n| WindowsPowerShell                           |\n| Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection |\n\n\\[Table 2\\] Folders Excluded from Encryption\n\n| **File Extensions Excluded from Encryption**                                                                                         |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| bat, bin, cab, cmd, com, cur, diagcab, diagcfg, diagpkg, drv, hlp, hta, msi, ocx, psm1, scr, sys, ini, url, dll, exe, ps1, !NT3RLOCK |\n\n\\[Table 3\\] File Extensions Excluded from Encryption\n\n| **Files Excluded from Encryption**    |\n| ------------------------------------- |\n| Thumbs.db, OPEN\\_BEFORE\\_ANYTHING.txt |\n\n\\[Table 4\\] Files Excluded from Encryption\n\nWhen encrypting files, the file name is changed to a pre-defined encrypted file extension (“.!NT3RLOCK”) and the agent performs the action to terminate the processes that are being encrypted, if the “-r” argument exists among the checked arguments. If the “-r” argument does not exist, the agent does not perform file encryption when the file name change fails.\n\n  \nFigure 2\\] File Encryption Logic\n\nThe AES key and initial value IV used for encryption are generated as random values and encrypted using RSA public key before being inserted at the end of the file.\n\n  \n\\[Figure 3\\] Generating AES Key Value and Initial Value (IV)\n\nBy checking the structure of the encrypted file as mentioned above, you can see that there are no clues left to decrypt the file in the local environment.\n\n  \n\\[Figure 4\\] The Structure of an Encrypted File\n\nMost ransomware variants utilize the encryption feature provided by Windows, but Interlock Ransomware uses a method implemented based on the OpenSSL library for the encryption process. The library is equipped with powerful encryption and key management capabilities, allowing for the efficient combination of the AES and RSA algorithms to encrypt files.\n\nTo prepare for ransomware, users must back up important data to an offsite separated from the service network, and perform access control on the backup storage and regular recovery drills. Strategic responses are essential to secure the backup system’s security and recoverability beyond simple backup.\n\n  \n\\[Figure 5\\] AES Encryption Logic Operating Based on OpenSSL Library\n\n# 3

the latest discoveries in cyber research for the week of 25th August, please download our [Threat Intelligence Bulletin][1].\n\n**TOP ATTACKS AND BREACHES**\n\n* US pharmaceutical company Inotiv has [experienced][2] a ransomware attack that resulted in the unauthorized access and encryption of certain systems and data. The Qilin ransomware gang claimed responsibility and alleged the theft of approximately 162,000 files totaling 176GB.\n\n_Check Point Threat Emulation and Harmony Endpoint provide protection against this threat_ _(Ransomware.Wins.Qilin.\\*)_\n\n* Belgian telecommunications company Orange Belgium has [experienced][3] a cyber attack that resulted in the compromise of data from 850,000 customer accounts. Exposed information includes names, phone numbers, SIM card numbers and PUK codes.\n* Australian Internet and mobile provider iiNet’s network has been [breached][4] in a cyber attack. Threat actors exfiltrated personal data of more than 200,000 customers of the company. According to reports, access was gained using an employee’s stolen credentials.\n* The Business Council of New York State (BCNYS) has [disclosed][5] a data breach that resulted in the theft of personal, financial, and health information belonging to over 47,000 individuals from an attack that occurred in February. The compromised data includes full names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, state identification numbers, financial and payment card information, taxpayer identification numbers, electronic signature information, and sensitive health records.\n* Bragg Gaming Group has [confirmed][6] a cyber attack that resulted in a compromise of its internal IT systems. Though the company states no customer or personal identifiable data was accessed or leaked. The impact was reportedly limited, with no disruption to gaming services or loss of account access, and no financial or personal data exposure has been detected.\n* DaVita, US healthcare company, has [confirmed][7] a cyber attack that occurred earlier this year, and resulted in the theft of sensitive personal and health information belonging to nearly 2.7 million individuals. The information includes names, addresses, dates of birth, social security numbers, health insurance details, treatment information, and dialysis lab test results.\n* Data I/O, global hardware company, has [suffered][8] a ransomware attack that resulted in outages of critical operational systems, including those used for shipping, manufacturing, production, and support functions. The attack has substantially impacted the company’s business operations.\n* Russian investment and analytics platform Investment Projects has [suffered][9] a cyber attack. The attack resulted in the platform being taken offline and the partial destruction of its infrastructure. The pro-Ukrainian hacker group, Cyber Anarchy Squad, claimed responsibility for the attack, saying that it had accessed internal databases and employee documents, and leaked stolen files.\n\n**VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHES**\n\n* Apple [issued][10] a patch for a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-43300) in Apple’s Image I/O framework affecting iOS, iPadOS, and macOS Sequoia, Sonoma, and Ventura. The vulnerability allows for an out-of-bounds write issue that may result in memory corruption or remote code execution. This flaw has been exploited in highly targeted, sophisticated attacks against specific individuals, and impacts a broad range of iPhone, iPad, and Mac models, both old and new. The vulnerability is triggered by processing malicious image files.\n* Security researchers have [discovered][11] a high-severity buffer overflow vulnerability (tracked as CVE-2025-9363) in the portTriggerManageRule function of Linksys RE-series models. This high-severity, remotely exploitable vulnerability (CVSSv3 score: 8.8) allows attackers to overwrite the stack by manipulating the triggerRuleName or schedule parameters, and a proof-of-concept exploit has already been publicly disclosed.\n* Google has [released][12] a security patch for Chrome that addresses the high severity vulnerability CVE-2025-9132, an out of bounds write issue which could be exploited remotely using crafted HTML pages. The vulnerability was discovered by Big Sleep, an AI agent developed by Google DeepMind.\n\n**THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORTS**\n\n* Security researchers have [released][13] a report detailing a series of coordinated campaigns  \nattributed to UAC-0057 (aka GhostWriter). These campaigns delivered a weaponized XLS spreadsheets with obfuscated VBA macros targeting Ukraine and Poland in mid-2025\\. The infection chain exploited compressed archives containing decoy documents and leveraged MacroPack-obfuscated macros to drop and load highly specific first-stage DLL implants.\n* Cisco have [issued][14] a report detailing activity of a Russia affiliated APT group Static Tundra. The group was observed exploiting seven-year-old vulnerability CVE-2018-0171 in Cisco IOS Smart Install to compromise unpatched and end-of-life network devices globally. The group employs techniques such as SYNful Knock firmware implants, targeting the telecom, education, and manufacturing sectors, specifically in Ukraine and its allies.\n* Researchers [detailed][15] a campaign by North Korean APT group Kimsuky targeting embassies and diplomatic missions in South Korea and globally. The campaign used spear-phishing emails with contextual diplomatic lures to deliver XenoRAT via malicious LNK files and PowerShell scripts, leveraging GitHub and cloud platforms for command-and-control and data exfiltration.\n* Researchers have [uncovered][16] a stealthy Linux malware delivery technique. This technique delivers a spam email containing a RAR archive whose filename embeds a Bash payload, triggering code execution when handled by unsanitized shell scripts or commands. The infection chain uses command injection in common scripting patterns to launch a Base64-encoded downloader, which fetches and silently executes a Go-based VShell backdoor.\n\n\n[1]:

Critical FortiSIEM flaw under active exploitation, Fortinet warns\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][1]  August 13, 2025 \n\n## Fortinet warns of a critical FortiSIEM vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-25256, that is actively exploited in attacks in the wild.\n\nFortinet warns customers of a critical vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-25256 (CVSS score of 9.8), affecting FortiSIEM for which an exploit exists in the wild.\n\nFortinet gave no details about the exploit, noting it leaves no clear Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).\n\nThe flaw is an OS command injection flaw that could allow unauthenticated attackers to run arbitrary code or commands via crafted CLI requests.\n\n_“An improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command (‘OS Command Injection’) vulnerability \\[CWE-78\\] in FortiSIEM may allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute unauthorized code or commands via crafted CLI requests.” [reads the advisory][2]. “Practical exploit code for this vulnerability was found in the wild.”_\n\nThe vulnerability impacts the following versions:\n\n* FortiSIEM 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6 (Migrate to a fixed release)\n* FortiSIEM 6.7.0 through 6.7.9 (Upgrade to 6.7.10 or above)\n* FortiSIEM 7.0.0 through 7.0.3 (Upgrade to 7.0.4 or above)\n* FortiSIEM 7.1.0 through 7.1.7 (Upgrade to 7.1.8 or above)\n* FortiSIEM 7.2.0 through 7.2.5 (Upgrade to 7.2.6 or above)\n* FortiSIEM 7.3.0 through 7.3.1 (Upgrade to 7.3.2 or above)\n\nFortiSIEM 7.4 is not affected by the flaw.\n\nAs workarounds, the vendor recommends that customers limit access to the phMonitor port (7900).\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][3]\n\n([SecurityAffairs][4] – hacking, [FortiSIEM][5])\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\n[1]: https://securityaffairs.com/author/paganinip\n[2]:

Citrix fixed three NetScaler flaws, one of them actively exploited in the wild\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][1]  August 26, 2025 \n\n## Citrix addressed three vulnerabilities in NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway, including one that has been actively exploited in the wild.\n\nCitrix [addressed][2] three security flaws (CVE-2025-7775, CVE-2025-7776, CVE-2025-8424) in NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway, including one (CVE-2025-7775) that it said has been actively exploited in the wild.\n\n“Exploits of CVE-2025-7775 on unmitigated appliances have been observed.” reads the advisory.\n\nBelow is the description for these vulnerabilities:\n\n* **CVE-2025-7775** (CVSS score: 9.2) – Memory overflow vulnerability leading to Remote Code Execution and/or Denial-of-Service. Pre-conditions for exploitation: NetScaler must be configured as Gateway (VPN virtual server, ICA Proxy, CVPN, RDP Proxy) or AAA virtual server; NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 13.1, 14.1, 13.1-FIPS and NDcPP: LB virtual servers of type (HTTP, SSL or HTTP\\_QUIC) bound with IPv6 services or servicegroups bound with IPv6 servers; NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 13.1, 14.1, 13.1-FIPS and NDcPP: LB virtual servers of type (HTTP, SSL or HTTP\\_QUIC) bound with DBS IPv6 services or servicegroups bound with IPv6 DBS servers; or CR virtual server with type HDX\n* **CVE-2025-7776** (CVSS score: 8.8) – Memory overflow vulnerability leading to unpredictable or erroneous behavior and Denial of Service. Pre-conditions for exploitation: NetScaler must be configured as Gateway (VPN virtual server, ICA Proxy, CVPN, RDP Proxy) with PCoIP Profile bounded to it.\n* **CVE-2025-8424** (CVSS score: 8.7) – Improper access control on the NetScaler Management Interface. Pre-conditions for exploitation: Access to NSIP, Cluster Management IP or local GSLB Site IP or SNIP with Management Access.\n\nThe company did not provide details about the attacks that exploited the flaw CVE-2025-7775.\n\nCloud Software Group urges NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway customers to promptly update to secure versions: 14.1-47.48+, 13.1-59.22+, 13.1-FIPS/NDcPP 13.1-37.241+, and 12.1-FIPS/NDcPP 12.1-55.330+. Installing these updates is critical to mitigate security risks.\n\nThe vendor states that no workarounds are available.\n\nThe researchers Jimi Sebree of Horizon3.ai, Jonathan Hetzer of Schramm & Partnerfor and François Hämmerli reported the vulnerabilities.\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][3]\n\n([SecurityAffairs][4] – hacking, newsletter)\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\n[1]:

When loading a specially crafted .webp animation an integer overflow can be made to occur when calculating the stride for decoding. Afterwards, this will cause a heap-based buffer to overflow when decoding the image which can lead to remote code execution. An attacker will need to convince the library to read a file to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n## **PDF-XChange out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities**\n\n_Discovered by KPC of Cisco Talos._\n\nPDF-XChange Editor allows the creation, editing, manipulation, and conversion of PDF files, conforming to international ISO specifications for PDF files.\n\n[TALOS-2025-2171][31] (CVE-2025-27931) and[ TALOS-2025-2203][32] (CVE-2025-47152) are out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities in the EMF functionality of PDF-XChange Editor version 10.5.2.395\\. By using a specially crafted EMF file, an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to perform an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information.\n\n## **Foxit memory corruption vulnerability**\n\n_Discovered by KPC of Cisco Talos._\n\nFoxit PDF Reader is a popular free program for viewing, creating, and editing PDF documents. It is commonly used as an alternative to Adobe Acrobat Reader and has a widely used browser plugin available.\n\n[TALOS-2025-2202][33] (CVE-2025-32451) is a memory corruption vulnerability in Foxit Reader 2025.1.0.27937\\. A specially crafted Javascript code inside a malicious PDF document can trigger this vulnerability, which can lead to memory corruption and result in arbitrary code execution. An attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious file to trigger this vulnerability. Exploitation is also possible if a user visits a specially crafted, malicious site if the browser plugin extension is enabled.\n\n\n[1]:

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVE-2025-8671, dubbed “**MadeYouReset**“, is a newly disclosed HTTP/2 denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability identified by researchers at Tel Aviv University and Imperva. It exploits a weakness in some HTTP/2 implementations that incorrectly treat server-sent stream resets as stream closures. Attackers can trigger servers to reset streams using crafted HTTP/2 frames (e.g., malformed WINDOW\\_UPDATE, PRIORITY, or data frames), while backend processing continues-thus bypassing the standard MAX\\_CONCURRENT\\_STREAMS limit and exhausting server resources. The vulnerability bypasses previous protections implemented against the 2023 “Rapid Reset” (CVE-2023-44487) attack and affects a broad range of servers and libraries (e.g., Apache Tomcat, Netty, Varnish, Fastly, F5, SUSE, Wind River). Although no exploitation in the wild has been confirmed, patches and mitigations are being actively released by vendors.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nOn August 13, 2025, researchers publicly disclosed a new HTTP/2 vulnerability known as “**MadeYouReset**” (CVE-2025-8671), which allows attackers to cause denial-of-service by exploiting mismatches in stream accounting within HTTP/2 server implementations. Unlike previous attacks, such as **Rapid Reset** (CVE-2023-44487), which used client-sent cancellations to overwhelm servers, MadeYouReset coerces the server into sending stream resets via crafted, often innocuous-looking frames-circumventing earlier mitigations. This report-prepared by CYFIRMA-provides a concise overview of the vulnerability, its impact, affected versions, mitigation strategies, and concluding insights.\n\n## DESCRIPTION\n\n**MadeYouReset** results from a flawed implementation where server-initiated stream resets (RST\\_STREAM) are treated as protocol-level closures, while backend processing continues. Attackers send malformed or edge-case HTTP/2 frames-such as invalid WINDOW\\_UPDATE increments, improper PRIORITY frames, or frames on half-closed streams-to trigger server-side resets. The server acknowledges the stream as closed, freeing it at the protocol level, but continues processing the request. This discrepancy allows attackers to bypass the concurrent stream limit and flood the server with backend work, leading to resource exhaustion and potential denial-of-service.\n\n## IMPACT\n\n* Bypasses standard HTTP/2 MAX\\_CONCURRENT\\_STREAMS limits-attackers can drive unbounded backend requests via a single connection.\n* This can cause severe CPU overload or memory exhaustion, leading to server crashes or service unavailability.\n* Existing Rapid Reset mitigations fail-MadeYouReset is subtler and more difficult to detect.\n* Affects numerous widely used platforms: Apache Tomcat, Netty, Varnish, Fastly, F5, SUSE, Wind River, etc.\n\n## AFFECTED VERSIONS\n\nMultiple vendor products are vulnerable:\n\n* Apache Tomcat\n* F5 BIG-IP\n* Netty\n* Jetty\n* Tomcat (SUSE packages)\n* h2 (Rust HTTP/2 library)\n\n## SECURITY INDICATORS\n\n**Is there already an exploit tool to attack this vulnerability?**  \nYes. As of now, there are some publicly available proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit tools targeting CVE-2025-8671 (MadeYouReset). Security disclosures (from sources like SUSE, Cloudflare, Netty, and Wind River) describe vulnerability and remediation.\n\n**Has this vulnerability already been used in an attack?**  \nNo confirmed in-the-wild exploitation has been reported. SUSE’s advisory explicitly notes that prior to August 13, 2025, there were no known attacks leveraging MadeYouReset. Other sources focus on describing the risk and mitigation, with no mention of active exploitation.\n\n**Are hackers discussing this vulnerability in the Deep/Dark Web?**  \nThere is no evidence that discussions, PoC trading, or exploit chatter on dark web or underground forums currently exist. All public information-CVE entries, vendor advisories, technical blogs-reflects coordinated, responsible disclosure.\n\n**What is the attack complexity level?**  \nThe attack can be classified as LOW complexity in implementation-assuming one understands how to craft HTTP/2 control-frame anomalies to induce server-side RST\\_STREAM behavior. However, because no PoC currently exists and deployment environments vary, it remains theoretical as of now. The underlying exploitation mechanics are straightforward based on technical write-ups, but real-world execution would require custom tooling and precise control.\n\n## EXPLOIT AND ANALYSIS\n\nThe attack leverages improper handling of HTTP/2 stream resets in lighttpd versions prior to 1.4.80\\. The exploitation sequence is twofold: reconnaissance and exploitation.\n\n**Vulnerability Detection and Reconnaissance**  \nThe attack first identifies whether the target web service is running a vulnerable instance of lighttpd. This is achieved by establishing a TCP connection to the specified host and port, sending a lightweight HTTP HEAD request, and parsing the Server’s response header. The version string is compared against the fixed version (1.4.80). If the version is lower, the service is flagged as vulnerable. This phase ensures that exploitation attempts are only directed toward susceptible systems.\n\n**Exploitation – HTTP/2 Stream Abuse**  \nOnce confirmed, the attacker initiates a raw TCP session to the HTTP/2 service port (commonly 8080 or HTTPS). Using an HTTP/2 client implementation (such as hyper-h2), the attacker negotiates an HTTP/2 session and sends a connection preface.\n\nThe exploit core involves rapidly creating new streams using HEADERS frames (typically GET requests to /) and then immediately sending RST\\_STREAM frames to reset them. Each reset forces the server to allocate and then prematurely tear down internal resources. When executed repeatedly (count parameter) or continuously, the server’s thread pool, memory buffers, or connection queues become saturated. This resource exhaustion results in degraded performance or complete denial of service.\n\n**Attack Characteristics**  \n**Statelessness:** No authentication or session tokens are required; the attack can originate remotely.\n\n**Low Bandwidth:** The payload size is small (stream creation and reset frames). The power lies in volume and concurrency.\n\n**Impact:** Causes service unavailability, timeouts, or process crashes.\n\n## MITIGATION\n\nApply vendor-released security updates immediately, including Apache Tomcat, Netty, Varnish, F5, Fastly, and SUSE. Temporarily disabling HTTP/2 or routing traffic via HTTP/1.1 can reduce exposure. Enforce stricter protocol validation-drop or treat malformed WINDOW\\_UPDATE, PRIORITY, or control frames as connection errors rather than stream errors. Implement control-frame rate limiting, per-client connection rate/cap, and monitor anomalies like high RST\\_STREAM generation or mismatched request processing patterns. Automated detection combined with traffic shaping or blocking of offending connections can further reduce risk until fully patched.\n\n## EXTERNAL THREAT LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT\n\n**Target Geography**  \nThe reach of CVE-2025-8671, known as MadeYouReset, is truly global. Any server supporting HTTP/2-be it web hosts, cloud front ends, API gateways, or edge infrastructure-worldwide could be targeted. Attackers can exploit this flaw, bypassing protocol-level stream limits and driving excessive backend processing over a single connection, enabling widespread denial-of-service threats. More than 2,837,441 instances may be vulnerable.\n\n**Target Industry**  \nIndustries most at risk include web hosting providers, cloud and CDN operators, finance and banking platforms, government services, and any enterprise relying on HTTP/2 for application delivery. These environments often handle high-volume and mission-critical traffic-successful exploitation could result in severe service disruption or outages. \n\n**Target Technology**  \nThis vulnerability stems from improper HTTP/2 stream management in implementations such as Apache Tomcat, Netty, Jetty, Varnish, Fastly, F5, AMPHP, Wind River, and others-including newer web servers like lighttpd and the Rust h2 library. The flaw allows attackers to trigger server-side RST\\_STREAM resets via crafted control frames (e.g., WINDOW\\_UPDATE with zero increment, invalid PRIORITY frames, HEADERS, or DATA on closed streams)-causing backend processing to continue while the protocol treats streams as closed, effectively circumventing concurrency limits and leading to resource exhaustion.\n\n## UNDERGROUND AND DARK WEB FORUMS\n\nCurrently, there are no threat actors actively discussing the vulnerability. However, the CYFIRMA Research team is continuously monitoring for new developments or discussions.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nMadeYouReset signals that even well-crafted mitigations like those for Rapid Reset may be sidestepped by subtle protocol behaviours. Organizations must maintain vigilance, align implementation behaviour with protocol specifications, and monitor anomalous stream processing patterns. Applying updates, hardening HTTP/2 validation, and gaining visibility into control-frame handling are crucial to safeguarding availability and resilience.","modified_at":null,"source_file":null,"customFields":[],"published_at":"2025-08-26T00:00:00+00:00","encryption_alg":null,"linked_reports":null,"linked_victims":null,"created_by_user":null,"linked_malwares":null,"linked_campaigns":null,"programming_lang":["Rust"],"victim_countries":null,"linked_identities":[{"id":"60a5b273-a897-3943-9160-78540cf75492","name":"Imperva","tags":null,"user_ids":null,"countries":null,"last_seen":null,"created_at":null,"first_seen":null,"updated_at":"2025-08-28T11:51:08.261+00:00","channel_ids":null,"description":null,"modified_at":null,"collected_at":"2025-08-28T11:51:08.261+00:00","endpoint_ids":[1],"provider_ids":null,"identity_class":"organization","linked_reports":["9856d3cd-3045-3ebc-9756-2a5988d3ecdc"],"linked_victims":null,"linked_malwares":null,"linked_campaigns":null,"linked_identities":null,"linked_observables":null,"linked_threat_actors":null,"linked_vulnerabilities":null},{"id":"9c051b01-ff67-371b-b480-fe2ded25774f","name":"CYFIRMA","tags":null,"user_ids":null,"countries":null,"last_seen":null,"created_at":null,"first_seen":null,"updated_at":"2025-10-24T09:37:26.975+00:00","channel_ids":null,"description":null,"modified_at":null,"collected_at":"2024-09-03T18:42:03.013+00:00","endpoint_ids":[1],"provider_ids":null,"identity_class":"organization","linked_reports":["a3337caa-8d9a-3651-bc99-c7f9f4eb8f2d","088ceb5a-b82e-30ee-b7d3-b14edf7ac97b","ec9daee8-2b5e-3bf4-99a1-4af3e680814a","e29c2a7e-e100-337b-b7c3-64993e5d00c0","cecffcab-c4de-3b9c-aada-a6f6deaa5067","92279463-244b-3493-81f8-d8da48124c87","e643d4a5-a6f5-3f81-bb9a-9c2c0712141d","bd4794b0-e5cb-38fe-9238-d2d4d075c7b7","fdb44810-ec3a-39f7-9b41-516c9ade0ac5","c1e22001-7080-3273-a2f1-8b0fc9bbafa8","333c08c6-3cff-3de4-89b0-58f5bfb4f530","f83040ce-20a5-3e18-9792-316de4e6fb3e","c29dec8a-79eb-3234-9e6f-50646b65c8e8","233abe03-b40b-3bb6-99fa-3d29d2a0037b","f6ec52dd-acfd-328c-863b-fcdf4f769271","d25ad9e9-5759-33f5-8cec-23ae6f9022e0","e2838a7d-a7be-30f5-b3d5-69b924b0dfeb","3e9daf9f-d9ae-34ba-aff0-c32d6c497eb1","e1db6680-040e-3fed-80bd-a894aac6ffbe","9aa9bff3-92f8-3e54-8fda-fe5637633e14","cfb78a29-65f0-31c6-907a-d3f320a6a8e9","1e13f6ee-05a1-3131-ab42-2d2522c67876","c6b41c8d-b0a0-3fa1-a77b-5cd2639691c3","ee271917-d128-3a0e-985d-64f190ac4364","9af2d250-4c82-3f6b-9276-0c49ea1fc03f","1c131eb6-8a2f-3ae1-898d-445d7add9ac6","ec6e0d95-a4e8-3345-b038-54b503fdfbbb","ba34ee07-451c-3db4-873a-b56a9e682a4b","f02aa5b8-72e2-31f5-a28c-5ecb68076f50","267e9808-2c1e-3f74-90d4-83279b07669c","cba22284-9d4b-3496-8c48-bd3e73106b19","410c9c54-e9b8-379b-af1d-9e06d280411c","747a7907-84ed-32ff-b0e0-9cf52290803c","63b04b32-85a1-3cfc-a4a2-839aa4f3dfa4","14968da5-6158-3aaa-9fe4-34a0fc158450","c6d920dc-6882-3736-a35d-f34fb4571821","5deef11d-f66a-370b-ae26-0726f1c66121","d36e381c-5f27-3d67-acb4-c98d86e30182","b9343e01-3edb-3a7f-990e-55f4f6f3aef6","a5aa85a0-cf69-365f-82a2-712bae7baf1e","0d2bcac5-7671-3e7b-a19d-77fa3996c251","ad1f2c71-b49a-3f09-a92f-3a443ae1f35a","6f268302-47fb-355d-aaa9-457f9666fd2e","dfa32636-e02c-3260-9ab1-c2280d17dc38","993759b4-1da9-353c-8c18-47811367d1bb","b50d6d7e-0171-3f4a-945f-9e6ce4eb8fc8","4f5808fe-05f5-30b8-9ca9-7cd4ed56554e","4991b8b0-aa7b-3f1c-abb8-41ae340bbddb","4852f33a-72f6-392a-aa4d-d32dd76cf810","a15c4063-3338-3787-a947-3bf8825aaea2","3fdf36fe-3093-3162-8d6a-0608472db9e5","0360a63a-ee52-398d-b952-c8d5a689c7df","482a0b3d-3440-3cad-8290-f84d335fc07a","9a05744f-48f1-3452-ab06-370f9bec2615","4172a997-4f97-3cc5-83d7-60a8dfafb60d","e7803956-3401-3a13-91a6-680b2ee2bac8","977c7104-0e1f-3e19-897d-30515172034b","8284ebda-ed8b-3e2e-a483-31e38b76ec96","3b0f462a-5b19-3645-a710-83d19066498a","5a0c7ff2-c263-3cc4-b766-73f660ed93a9","4bd03b4a-6728-3d6b-bb67-ba35f2b2a871","5f8882a0-45ff-3077-a837-cc461f4b5ed9","ea4f752a-33c6-3f2c-8c73-419880c96715","9856d3cd-3045-3ebc-9756-2a5988d3ecdc","2adf3f1c-14c3-30ed-aee3-e642547fee51","67520b72-11cd-35d9-bfb7-f90397f7342a","41f6759a-0d79-38ef-893b-f556c17ca209"],"linked_victims":null,"linked_malwares":null,"linked_campaigns":null,"linked_identities":null,"linked_observables":null,"linked_threat_actors":null,"linked_vulnerabilities":null},{"id":"fc9f16b3-b538-398e-9d68-3824bc6f4c9a","name":"Cloudflare","tags":null,"user_ids":null,"countries":null,"last_seen":null,"created_at":null,"first_seen":null,"updated_at":"2025-09-09T07:29:35.973+00:00","channel_ids":null,"description":null,"modified_at":null,"collected_at":"2024-09-03T08:47:28.66+00:00","endpoint_ids":[1],"provider_ids":null,"identity_class":"organization","linked_reports":["a43a845a-1061-398c-8ab6-0d3bab5c36d7","9856d3cd-3045-3ebc-9756-2a5988d3ecdc","8ae9327b-91bf-3ccb-b663-bc4147b88f92","22b1b693-77a1-33f0-b976-1daaf2fe5d4c","0211c18a-f8b0-3572-bc2e-1c5d934a3b56","034f8ed1-a044-3f87-8a08-a8994cb0460a","db703499-e716-30e7-a633-a9e274d3f73a","47f98528-4a31-388f-b420-ac8ddd84f42a","e5db903d-b221-3a0c-a80c-a97eb3ebd1d0","4852f33a-72f6-392a-aa4d-d32dd76cf810","d4180f38-f727-31d3-870a-89468677a60c","42941900-63f8-359d-8b4a-28780406a4fe","e0

technique, which is a tactic that prompts users to enter PowerShell commands directly. · In January 2025, they distributed a .vbs script via a disguised interview email. · In March, they sent a manual that included Code.txt to a U.S. national security advisor impersonating email. · The ClickFix technique is designed to trick users into thinking that they are troubleshooting, leading them to manually execute malicious commands. · Disguised in various forms, such as a fake portal login page and a job search site in the defense industry · After infection, the threat actor’s scheduled tasks are registered, C2 communication is established, and information is collected automatically · Related infrastructure (IP, domain) is distributed across multiple countries including Korea, China, and Vietnam · In some cases, cloud-based file delivery services such as Proton Drive and Google Drive are used |\n| Source                  | Analysis of the threat case of kimsuky group using ‘ClickFix’

China linked Silk Typhoon targeted diplomats by hijacking web traffic\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][1]  August 27, 2025 \n\n## The China-linked APT group Silk Typhoon targeted diplomats by hijacking web traffic to redirect it to a website that delivered malware.\n\nChina-linked cyberespionage group [Silk Typhoon][2] targeted diplomats by hijacking web traffic to redirect to a website used to deliver malware, Google’s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) warns.\n\nCyberspies hijacked a network’s captive portal using an advanced adversary-in-the-middle ([AitM][3]) technique to deliver malware. GTIG links the group, UNC6384, to the Chinese threat actor TEMP.Hex, also known as [Mustang Panda][4] or Silk Typhoon.\n\nIn March 2025, Google identified a sophisticated cyber espionage campaign by UNC6384, targeting diplomats in Southeast Asia and globally. The attack hijacked web traffic via captive portal redirects, delivering a signed downloader (STATICPLUGIN) that installed the [PlugX backdoor][5] (SOGU.SEC). \n\nGTIG found that attackers hijacked captive portals to deliver malware disguised as an Adobe Plugin update. \n\nThe attackers trick targets into downloading malware disguised as a “plugin update” via a fake software update site using HTTPS and a valid TLS certificate. The page appears legitimate, displaying a blank landing page with an “Install Missing Plugins…” button. When clicked, JavaScript triggers the download of “AdobePlugins.exe” while showing a background image with execution instructions. The fake installer runs, but the SOGU.SEC backdoor is already active, bypassing Windows security.\n\nLegitimate browser redirects (via gstatic.com) were abused in an adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attack, likely through compromised edge devices, though the initial compromise method remains unknown.\n\n_“A captive portal is a network setup that directs users to a specific webpage, usually a login or splash page, before granting internet access. This functionality is intentionally built into all web browsers. The Chrome browser performs an HTTP request to a hardcoded URL (`“http://www.gstatic.com/generate204`”) to enable this redirect mechanism.” states the GTIG’s [**report**][6]._\n\n_“While “`gstatic.com`” is a legitimate domain, our investigation uncovered redirect chains from this domain leading to the threat actor’s landing webpage and subsequent malware delivery, indicating an AitM attack. “_\n\nUpon delivery to a Windows system, the malware launches a multi-stage chain designed to evade defenses and remain stealthy. The first stage, STATICPLUGIN, is a digitally signed downloader disguised as a legitimate installer. It retrieves an MSI package, which installs CANONSTAGER, a launcher that side-loads and executes the encrypted SOGU.SEC backdoor entirely in memory.\n\nCANONSTAGER employs advanced evasion techniques, including API hashing, Thread Local Storage (TLS) for storing function addresses, and indirect code execution via Windows message queues and hidden window procedures. This allows SOGU.SEC to decrypt and run without leaving artifacts on the disk, bypassing security tools while maintaining communication with the attacker’s command-and-control server. The malware leverages legitimate Windows features and digitally signed binaries to appear credible and avoid detection.\n\n_“This campaign is a clear example of the continued evolution of UNC6384’s operational capabilities and highlights the sophistication of PRC-nexus threat actors. The use of advanced techniques such as AitM combined with valid code signing and layered social engineering demonstrates this threat actor’s capabilities.” concludes the report. “This activity follows a broader trend GTIG has observed of PRC-nexus threat actors increasingly [employing][7] [stealthy][8] tactics to avoid [detection][9].”_\n\nGoogle published indicators of compromise (IoCs) and YARA rules for detecting malware employed in the attacks.\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][10]\n\n([SecurityAffairs][11] – hacking, Silk Typhoon)\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\n[1]:

Over 28,000 Citrix instances remain exposed to critical RCE flaw CVE-2025-7775\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][1]  August 27, 2025 \n\n## Over 28,200 Citrix NetScaler ADC/Gateway instances remain exposed to critical RCE flaw CVE-2025-7775, already under active exploitation.\n\nExperts at the Shadowserver Foundation warn that more than 28,200 Citrix instances are vulnerable to the vulnerability [CVE-2025-7775][2], which is under active exploitation.\n\nCVE-2025-7775 (CVSS score: 9.2) is a memory overflow vulnerability leading to Remote Code Execution and/or Denial-of-Service. \n\nThis week, Citrix [addressed][3] three security flaws (CVE-2025-7775, CVE-2025-7776, CVE-2025-8424) in NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway, including one (CVE-2025-7775) that it said has been actively exploited in the wild.\n\n“Exploits of CVE-2025-7775 on unmitigated appliances have been observed.” reads the [advisory][3].\n\nThe U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) [added][4] the Citrix NetScaler flaw to its [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog][5]. The US Agency orders federal agencies to fix the vulnerabilities by August 28, 2025.\n\nShadowserver Foundation researchers reported that [most of the vulnerable instances][6] are located in the United States (10,100), followed by Germany (4,300), the United Kingdom (1,400), the Netherlands (1,300), and Switzerland (1,300).\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][7]\n\n([SecurityAffairs][8] – hacking,

U.S. CISA adds Citrix NetScaler flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][1]  August 27, 2025 \n\n## U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) adds Citrix NetScaler flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog.\n\nThe U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) [added][2] Citrix NetScaler flaw, tracked as [CVE-2025-7775][3], to its [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog][4].\n\nThis week, Citrix [addressed][5] three security flaws (CVE-2025-7775, CVE-2025-7776, CVE-2025-8424) in NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway, including one (CVE-2025-7775) that it said has been actively exploited in the wild.\n\n“Exploits of CVE-2025-7775 on unmitigated appliances have been observed.” reads the advisory.\n\nBelow is the description for these vulnerabilities:\n\n* **CVE-2025-7775** (CVSS score: 9.2) – Memory overflow vulnerability leading to Remote Code Execution and/or Denial-of-Service. Pre-conditions for exploitation: NetScaler must be configured as Gateway (VPN virtual server, ICA Proxy, CVPN, RDP Proxy) or AAA virtual server; NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 13.1, 14.1, 13.1-FIPS and NDcPP: LB virtual servers of type (HTTP, SSL or HTTP\\_QUIC) bound with IPv6 services or servicegroups bound with IPv6 servers; NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 13.1, 14.1, 13.1-FIPS and NDcPP: LB virtual servers of type (HTTP, SSL or HTTP\\_QUIC) bound with DBS IPv6 services or servicegroups bound with IPv6 DBS servers; or CR virtual server with type HDX\n* **CVE-2025-7776** (CVSS score: 8.8) – Memory overflow vulnerability leading to unpredictable or erroneous behavior and Denial of Service. Pre-conditions for exploitation: NetScaler must be configured as Gateway (VPN virtual server, ICA Proxy, CVPN, RDP Proxy) with PCoIP Profile bounded to it.\n* **CVE-2025-8424** (CVSS score: 8.7) – Improper access control on the NetScaler Management Interface. Pre-conditions for exploitation: Access to NSIP, Cluster Management IP or local GSLB Site IP or SNIP with Management Access.\n\nThe company did not provide details about the attacks that exploited the flaw CVE-2025-7775.\n\nCloud Software Group urges NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway customers to promptly update to secure versions: 14.1-47.48+, 13.1-59.22+, 13.1-FIPS/NDcPP 13.1-37.241+, and 12.1-FIPS/NDcPP 12.1-55.330+. Installing these updates is critical to mitigate security risks.\n\nThe vendor states that no workarounds are available.\n\nAccording to [Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities][6], FCEB agencies have to address the identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect their networks against attacks exploiting the flaws in the catalog.\n\nExperts also recommend that private organizations review the [Catalog][4] and address the vulnerabilities in their infrastructure.\n\nCISA orders federal agencies to fix the vulnerabilities by August 28, 2025.\n\n[**Pierluigi Paganini**][7]\n\n**(**[**SecurityAffairs**][8] **–** **hacking, [CISA][9])**\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\n[1]:

Over 100 Dell models exposed to critical ControlVault3 firmware bugs\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][1]  August 07, 2025 \n\n## ReVault flaws in Dell ControlVault3 firmware allow firmware implants and Windows login bypass on 100+ laptop models via physical access.\n\nCisco Talos reported [five vulnerabilities][2] collectively named ReVault (tracked as CVE-2025-24311, CVE-2025-25215, CVE-2025-24922, CVE-2025-25050, and CVE-2025-24919) in Dell’s ControlVault3 firmware that expose over 100 laptop models to firmware implants and Windows login bypass via physical access.\n\nOn June 13, Dell disclosed these vulnerabilities impacting Dell Pro, Latitude, and Precision laptop models. \n\nControlVault3 is a hardware-based security module found in many Dell laptops, including Latitude, Precision, and XPS models. It provides a secure environment for storing and processing sensitive data such as user passwords, biometric information, security codes, and encryption keys.\n\n_“The ReVault attack can be used as a post-compromise persistence technique that can remain even across Windows reinstalls.” reads the [advisory][3] published by Talos. “The ReVault attack can also be used as a physical compromise to bypass Windows Login and/or for any local user to gain Admin/System privileges.”_ \n\nBelow are the descriptions of the flaws:\n\n* CVE-2025-24311 (CVSS score of 8.4): An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the cv\\_send\\_blockdata functionality of Dell ControlVault3 prior to 5.15.10.14 and Dell ControlVault3 Plus prior to 6.2.26.36\\. A specially crafted ControlVault API call can lead to an information leak. An attacker can trigger the flaw by issuing an API call.\n* CVE-2025-25215 (CVSS score of 8.8): An arbitrary free vulnerability exists in the cv\\_close functionality of Dell ControlVault3 prior to 5.15.10.14 and Dell ControlVault3 Plus prior to 6.2.26.36\\. A specially crafted ControlVault API call can lead to an arbitrary free. An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by forging a fake session.\n* CVE-2025-24922 (CVSS score of 8.8): A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the securebio\\_identify functionality of Dell ControlVault3 prior to 5.15.10.14 and Dell ControlVault3 Plus prior to 6.2.26.36\\. A specially crafted malicious cv\\_object can lead to a arbitrary code execution. An attacker can issue an API call to trigger this vulnerability.\n* CVE-2025-25050 (CVSS score of 8.8): An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the cv\\_upgrade\\_sensor\\_firmware functionality of Dell ControlVault3 prior to 5.15.10.14 and Dell ControlVault 3 Plus prior to 6.2.26.36\\. A specially crafted ControlVault API call can lead to an out-of-bounds write. An attacker can issue an API call to trigger this vulnerability.\n* CVE-2025-24919 (CVSS score of 8.1): A deserialization of untrusted input vulnerability exists in the cvhDecapsulateCmd functionality of Dell ControlVault3 prior to 5.15.10.14 and ControlVault3 Plus prior to 6.2.26.36\\. A specially crafted ControlVault response to a command can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can compromise a ControlVault firmware and have it craft a malicious response to trigger this vulnerability.\n\nThe impact of these vulnerabilities is severe, due to both the lack of standard security mitigations and the ability to chain certain flaws. In one attack scenario, a non-admin Windows user could exploit the vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the firmware. This could expose sensitive cryptographic material and allow permanent firmware modification, potentially enabling a hidden implant that could later be used to compromise the system further. In a second scenario presented by the researchers, a local attacker with physical access could bypass login and disk encryption by connecting directly to the firmware hardware, even tricking the system into accepting fake fingerprints if biometric login is enabled.\n\nTo reduce the risk of attack, Talos advises keeping systems updated with the latest firmware, which can be installed via Windows Update or manually from Dell’s website. If security peripherals like fingerprint or smart card readers aren’t in use, ControlVault (CV) services or devices can be disabled through the Service or Device Manager. In high-risk situations, Talos researchers also recommend disabling fingerprint login. Windows’ Enhanced Sign-in Security (ESS) may help detect tampered firmware. For detection, enabling chassis intrusion alerts in BIOS can flag physical tampering, and unusual crashes in biometric or credential services may indicate compromise. Cisco Secure Endpoint can also detect suspicious behavior linked to CV exploitation.\n\n_“These findings highlight the importance of evaluating the security posture of all hardware components within your devices, not just the operating system or software. As Talos demonstrated, vulnerabilities in widely-used firmware such as Dell ControlVault can have far-reaching implications, potentially compromising even advanced security features like biometric authentication.” concludes Talos. “Staying vigilant, patching your systems and proactively assessing risk are essential to safeguard your systems against evolving threats. “_\n\n[Pierluigi

Trend Micro fixes two actively exploited Apex One RCE flaws\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][1]  August 06, 2025 \n\n## Trend Micro patched two critical Apex One flaws (CVE-2025-54948, CVE-2025-54987) exploited in the wild, allowing RCE via console injection.\n\nTrend Micro released fixes for two critical vulnerabilities, tracked as CVE-2025-54948 and CVE-2025-54987 (CVSS score of 9.4), in Apex One on-prem consoles. The cybersecurity vendor confirmed that both issues were actively exploited in the wild.\n\nBoth vulnerabilities are command injection remote code execution (RCE) issues on Apex One Management Console (on-premise).\n\n_“Trend Micro has observed as least one instance of an attempt to actively exploit one of these vulnerabilities in the wild.” reads the [advisory][2] published by the company._\n\nThe company did not publish details about the attacks exploiting these vulnerabilities. \n\nBelow are the descriptions of the two flaws:\n\n* **CVE-2025-54948**: A vulnerability in Trend Micro Apex One (on-premise) management console could allow a pre-authenticated remote attacker to upload malicious code and execute commands on affected installations.\n* **CVE-2025-54987**: A vulnerability in Trend Micro Apex One (on-premise) management console could allow a pre-authenticated remote attacker to upload malicious code and execute commands on affected installations. This vulnerability is essentially the same as CVE-2025-54948 but targets a different CPU architecture.\n\nJacky Hsieh @ CoreCloud Tech working with [Trend Zero Day Initiative][3] reported both CVE-2025-54948 and CVE-2025-54987.\n\nTrend Micro has deployed mitigations for Apex One as a Service as of July 31, 2025\\. For on-premise users, a temporary [fix tool][4] is available, with a full patch expected by mid-August. While the tool blocks known exploits, it disables the Remote Install Agent feature in the console. According to the advisory, other install methods, like UNC path or agent package, remain unaffected.\n\n_“Exploiting these type of vulnerabilities generally require that an attacker has access (physical or remote) to a vulnerable machine. In addition to timely application of patches and updated solutions, customers are also advised to review remote access to critical systems and ensure policies and perimeter security is up-to-date.” concludes the advisory._\n\n_For this particular vulnerability, an attacker must have access to the Trend Micro Apex One Management Console, so customers that have their console’s IP address exposed externally should consider mitigating factors such as source restrictions if not already applied._“\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][5]\n\n([SecurityAffairs][6] – hacking, Apex One)\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\n[1]:

Talos’ Vulnerability Discovery & Research team recently disclosed seven vulnerabilities in WWBN AVideo, four in MedDream, and one in an Eclipse ThreadX module.\n\nThe vulnerabilities mentioned in this blog post have been patched by their respective vendors, all in adherence to[ Cisco’s third-party vulnerability disclosure policy][1]. \n\nFor Snort coverage that can detect the exploitation of these vulnerabilities, download the latest rule sets from[ Snort.org][2], and our latest Vulnerability Advisories are always posted on[ Talos Intelligence’s website][3]. \n\n## **WWBN XSS, race condition, incomplete blacklist vulnerabilities**\n\n_Discovered by Claudio Bozzato of Cisco Talos._\n\nWWBN AVideo is a video streaming platform with hosting, management, and video monetization features.\n\nTalos found five cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in WWBN AVideo 14.4 and dev master commit 8a8954ff:\n\n* [TALOS-2025-2205][4] (CVE-2025-46410)\n* [TALOS-2025-2206][5]

Javascript execution in all five cases. An attacker must get a user to visit a webpage to trigger these vulnerabilities.\n\nAdditionally, Talos identified two vulnerabilities that, when chained together, can lead to arbitrary code execution:\n\n[TALOS-2025-2212][9] (CVE-2025-25214) A race condition vulnerability exists in the aVideoEncoder.json.php unzip functionality of WWBN AVideo 14.4 and dev master commit 8a8954ff. A series of specially crafted HTTP requests can lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\n[TALOS-2025-2213][10] (CVE-2025-48732) An incomplete blacklist exists in the .htaccess sample of WWBN AVideo 14.4 and dev master commit 8a8954ff. A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can request a .phar file to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n## **MedDream**\n\n_Discovered by Emmanuel Tacheau and Marcin Noga of Cisco Talos._\n\nMedDream PACS Premium is a DICOM 3.0 compliant picture archiving and communication system for the medical industry. The PACS server provides connectivity to all DICOM modalities (CR, DX, CT, MR, US, XA, etc.).\n\nTalos found four unique MedDreams PACS Premium vulnerabilities.\n\n[TALOS-2025-2154][11] (CVE-2025-26469) is an incorrect default permissions vulnerability in the CServerSettings::SetRegistryValues functionality of MedDream PACS Premium 7.3.3.840\\. A specially crafted application can decrypt credentials stored in a configuration-related registry key. An attacker can execute a malicious script or application to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n[TALOS-2025-2156][12] (CVE-2025-27724) is a privilege escalation vulnerability in the login.php functionality of meddream MedDream PACS Premium 7.3.3.840\\. A specially crafted .php file can lead to elevated capabilities. An attacker can upload a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n[TALOS-2025-2176][13] (CVE-2025-32731) is a reflected XSS vulnerability in the radiationDoseReport.php functionality of meddream MedDream PACS Premium 7.3.5.860\\. A specially crafted malicious URL can lead to arbitrary JavaScript code execution. An attacker can provide a crafted URL to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n[TALOS-2025-2177][14] (CVE-2025-24485) is a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the cecho.php functionality of MedDream PACS Premium 7.3.5.860\\. A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to SSRF. An attacker can make an unauthenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n## **Eclipse ThreadX FileX integer underflow vulnerability**\n\n_Discovered by Kelly Patterson of Cisco Talos._\n\nEclipse ThreadX is an embedded development suite for an advanced real-time operating system (RTOS) that provides efficient performance for resource-constrained devices. \n\n[TALOS-2024-2088][15] is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the FileX RAM disk driver functionality of Eclipse ThreadX FileX git commit 1b85eb2\\. A specially crafted set of network packets can lead to code execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n\n[1]: https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor%5Fvulnerability%5Fpolicy.html\n[2]:

U.S. CISA adds D-Link cameras and Network Video Recorder flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][1]  August 06, 2025 \n\n## U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) adds D-Link cameras and Network Video Recorder flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog.\n\nThe U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) [added][2] Cisco ISE and PaperCut NG/MF flaws to its [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog][3].\n\nBelow are the descriptions for these flaws:\n\n* [CVE-2020-25078][4] D-Link DCS-2530L and DCS-2670L Devices Unspecified Vulnerability. A vulnerability in D-Link DCS-2530L (pre-1.06.01 Hotfix) and DCS-2670L (up to 2.02) allows remote attackers to access the admin password via an unauthenticated endpoint.\n* [CVE-2020-25079][5] D-Link DCS-2530L and DCS-2670L Command Injection Vulnerability. D-Link DCS-2530L (pre-1.06.01 Hotfix) and DCS-2670L (up to 2.02) devices have a flaw in `cgi-bin/ddns_enc.cgi` that allows authenticated command injection.\n* [CVE-2022-40799][6] D-Link DNR-322L Download of Code Without Integrity Check Vulnerability. A data integrity flaw in the “Backup Config” feature of D-Link DNR-322L (≤ 2.60B15) lets authenticated attackers run OS-level commands on the device.\n\nAccording to [Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities][7], FCEB agencies have to address the identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect their networks against attacks exploiting the flaws in the catalog.\n\nExperts also recommend that private organizations review the [Catalog][3] and address the vulnerabilities in their infrastructure.\n\nCISA orders federal agencies to fix the vulnerabilities by August 26, 2025.\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][8]\n\n([SecurityAffairs][9] – hacking, [cisa][10])\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\n[1]:

Google fixed two Qualcomm bugs that were actively exploited in the wild\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][1]  August 06, 2025 \n\n## Google addressed multiple Android flaws, including two Qualcomm vulnerabilities that were actively exploited in the wild.\n\nGoogle released [security updates][2] to address multiple Android vulnerabilities, including two Qualcomm flaws, tracked as [CVE-2025-21479][3] (CVSS score: 8.6) and [CVE-2025-27038][3] (CVSS score: 7.5), that were actively exploited in the wild.\n\nIn June, Google Android Security team [**reported**][3] three issues, tracked as CVE-2025-21479, CVE-2025-21480, CVE-2025-27038, to Qualcomm.\n\n_“There are indications from Google Threat Analysis Group that CVE-2025-21479, CVE-2025-21480, CVE-2025-27038 may be under limited, targeted exploitation.” reads the [report][4] published by the vendor. “Patches for the issues affecting the Adreno Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) driver have been made available to OEMs in May together with a strong recommendation to deploy the update on affected devices as soon as possible.”_\n\nBelow are the descriptions of these vulnerabilities:\n\n* CVE-2025-21479 (CVSS score: 8.6) – The flaw is an Incorrect Authorization issue in the Graphics component. _“Memory corruption due to unauthorized command execution in GPU micronode while executing specific sequence of commands.” reads the [advisory][4]._\n* CVE-2025-21480 (CVSS score: 8.6) – The flaw is an Incorrect Authorization issue in Graphics Windows. _“Memory corruption due to unauthorized command execution in GPU micronode while executing specific sequence of commands.” reads the advisory._\n* CVE-2025-27038 (CVSS score: 7.5) – The flaw is a use-after-free issue in the Graphics component. _“Memory corruption while rendering graphics using Adreno GPU drivers in Chrome.” states the advisory._\n\nThe company did not share details about the attacks exploiting the three vulnerabilities.\n\nIn early July, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) [added][5] the Qualcomm chipsets flaws to its [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog][6].\n\nThe most severe flaw addressed by Google is a critical vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-48530, in the System component that enabled remote code execution without user interaction or extra privileges, when combined with other bugs.\n\nThe company released two Android patch levels, 2025-08-01 and 2025-08-05, with the latter including fixes from Arm and Qualcomm. Users are urged to update as soon as possible.\n\n[Pierluigi Paganini][7]\n\n([SecurityAffairs][8] – hacking, Android)\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\n[1]: https://securityaffairs.com/author/paganinip\n[2]:

Dell refers to the daughter board as a Unified Security Hub (USH), as it is used as a hub to run ControlVault (CV), connecting various security peripherals such as a fingerprint reader, smart card reader and NFC reader. \n\nHere is a photographic example of a USH board: ​​​​\n\nThis is the board in its natural environment: \n\nThe current iterations of the product are called ControlVault3 and ControlVault3+. and can be found in more than 100 different models of actively-supported Dell laptops (see [DSA-2025-053][2]), mostly from the business-centric Lattitude and Precision series. These laptop models are widely used in the cybersecurity industry, government settings and challenging environments in their Rugged version. Sensitive industries that require heightened security when logging in (via smartcard or NFC) are more likely to find ControlVault devices in their environment, as they are necessary to enable these security features. \n\n# Findings \n\nToday, Talos is publishing five CVEs and their associated reports. The vulnerabilities include multiple out-of-bounds vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-24311, CVE-2025-25050) an arbitrary free (CVE-2025-25215) and a stack-overflow (CVE-2025-24922), all affecting the CV firmware. We also reported an unsafe-deserialization (CVE-2025-24919) that affects ControlVault’s Windows APIs. \n\n# Impact \n\nWith a lack of common security mitigations and the combination of some of the vulnerabilities mentioned above, the impact of these findings is significant. Let’s highlight two of the most critical attack scenarios we have uncovered. \n\n## Post-compromise pivot \n\nOn the Windows side, a non-administrative user can interact with the CV firmware using its associated APIs and trigger an Arbitrary Code Execution on the CV firmware. From this vantage point, it becomes possible to leak key material essential to the security of the device, thus gaining the ability to permanently modify its firmware. This creates the risk of a so-called implant that could stay unnoticed in a laptop’s CV firmware and eventually be used as a pivot back onto the system in the case of a Threat Actor’s post-compromise strategy. The following video shows how a tampered CV firmware can be used to “hack Windows” by leveraging the unsafe deserialization bug mentioned previously. \n\n## Physical attack \n\nA local attacker with physical access to a user’s laptop can pry it open and directly access the USH board over USB with a custom connector. From there, all the vulnerabilities described previously become in-scope for the attacker without requiring the ability to log-in into the system or knowing a full-disk encryption password. While chassis-intrusion can be detected, this is a feature that needs to be enabled beforehand to be effective at warning of a potential tampering. \n\nAnother interesting consequence of this scenario is that if a system is configured to be unlocked with the user’s fingerprint, it is also possible to tamper with the CV firmware to accept any fingerprint rather than only allowing a legitimate user’s. \n\n# Remediation \n\n## Mitigation \n\nTo mitigate these attacks, Talos recommends the following: \n\n* Keep your system up to date to ensure the latest firmware is installed. CV firmware can be automatically deployed via Windows Update, but new firmware usually gets released on the Dell website a few weeks prior.\n* If not using any of the security peripherals (fingerprint reader, smart card reader and NFC reader) it is possible to disable the CV services (using the Service Manager) and/or the CV device (via the Device Manager).\n* It is also worth considering disabling fingerprint login when risks are heightened (e.g., leaving one’s laptop unattended in a hotel room). Windows also provides Enhanced Sign-in Security (ESS), which may help mitigate some of the physical attacks and detect inappropriate CV firmware.\n\n## Detection \n\nTo detect an attack, consider the following: \n\n* Depending on your laptop model, chassis intrusion detection can be enabled in the computer’s BIOS. This would flag physical tampering and may require entering a password to clear the alert and restart the computer.\n* In the Windows logs, unexpected crashes of the Windows Biometric Service or the various Credential Vault services could be a sign of compromise.\n* Cisco customers using Cisco Secure Endpoint can be made aware of potential risks with the signature definition “bcmbipdll.dll Loaded by Abnormal Process”.\n\n# Conclusion \n\nThese findings highlight the importance of evaluating the security posture of all hardware components within your devices, not just the operating system or software. As Talos demonstrated, vulnerabilities in widely-used firmware such as Dell ControlVault can have far-reaching implications, potentially compromising even advanced security features like biometric authentication.
